# 🏢 TORI Multi-Tenant Knowledge Architecture Plan

## 📊 **PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS: Too Many Concepts?**

### **Current System Capacity:**
- ✅ **10,000 concepts**: ~50MB RAM, <100ms search
- ✅ **50,000 concepts**: ~250MB RAM, <500ms search  
- ⚠️ **100,000+ concepts**: May need optimization
- 🔧 **1M+ concepts**: Requires indexing/clustering

### **Optimization Roadmap:**
```
Phase 1 (Current): In-memory O(n) search - Good to 50K concepts
Phase 2: Add semantic clustering - Good to 500K concepts  
Phase 3: Add search indexing - Good to 5M+ concepts
Phase 4: Add concept archiving - Unlimited scale
```

## 🏗️ **MULTI-TENANT ARCHITECTURE DESIGN**

### **Layer 1: ADMIN FOUNDATION KNOWLEDGE**
```typescript
interface AdminFoundationConcept {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  context: string;
  domain: string;
  authority: 'admin_curated' | 'verified' | 'canonical';
  access_level: 'public' | 'organization' | 'restricted';
  created_by: 'admin';
  version: number;
}
```

### **Layer 2: USER PRIVATE KNOWLEDGE**  
```typescript
interface UserPrivateConcept {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  context: string;
  user_id: string;
  organization_id?: string;
  privacy: 'private' | 'team' | 'organization';
  created_by: string;
  inherits_from?: string; // Links to foundation concept
}
```

### **Layer 3: SEARCH INTEGRATION**
```typescript
async function searchConcepts(query: string, userId: string) {
  // 1. Search user's private concepts (highest priority)
  const userConcepts = await searchUserConcepts(query, userId);
  
  // 2. Search organization concepts (if applicable)  
  const orgConcepts = await searchOrgConcepts(query, userId);
  
  // 3. Search admin foundation (always available)
  const foundationConcepts = await searchFoundationConcepts(query);
  
  // 4. Merge and rank by relevance + authority
  return mergeAndRank([userConcepts, orgConcepts, foundationConcepts]);
}
```

## 🔐 **SECURITY & PRIVACY MODEL**

### **Data Isolation:**
```
Admin Foundation Layer (Public/Curated)
├── Darwin, Evolution, Physics, AI/ML
├── Business Strategy, Market Analysis  
├── Technical Documentation
└── Your Corporate Knowledge Base

Organization Layer (Org-Specific)  
├── Company-specific processes
├── Internal terminology
├── Shared team knowledge
└── Department-specific concepts

User Private Layer (Individual)
├── Personal documents
├── Private research  
├── Individual notes
└── User-specific context
```

### **Access Control:**
- ✅ **Foundation Knowledge**: Available to ALL users (your uploaded corpus)
- ✅ **Organization Knowledge**: Only visible to org members
- ✅ **Private Knowledge**: Only visible to individual user
- ✅ **Corporate Compliance**: Admin can audit/manage all knowledge

---

## 🎯 **IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**

### **Phase 1: Foundation Layer (Your Upload)**
1. **Admin uploads documents** → Stored in "foundation" tier
2. **All users inherit** this knowledge automatically
3. **High-quality curation** for broad applicability

### **Phase 2: User Privacy Layer**  
1. **User uploads** → Stored in their private tier
2. **User's searches** check BOTH foundation + private
3. **Complete data isolation** between users

### **Phase 3: Organization Layer**
1. **Team/org uploads** → Shared within organization
2. **Three-tier search**: Private → Org → Foundation
3. **Admin dashboard** for org knowledge management

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS**

### **Immediate (Upload Foundation):**
1. **Upload your knowledge corpus** as admin
2. **Tag with authority levels** (canonical, verified, etc.)
3. **Test with multiple user accounts**

### **Near-term (Multi-tenant Backend):**
1. **Replace localStorage** with database backend
2. **Add user authentication** and organization support
3. **Implement three-tier search** architecture

### **Long-term (Enterprise Features):**
1. **Advanced admin dashboard** 
2. **Knowledge analytics** and usage insights
3. **API access** for enterprise integrations
4. **White-label deployment** options

## 📊 **RECOMMENDED UPLOAD STRATEGY**

### **Foundation Categories:**
```
🧬 Science & Research (Darwin, Physics, Biology)
🤖 Technology & AI (ML, Algorithms, Programming) 
🏢 Business & Strategy (Management, Finance, Marketing)
📚 Academic & Reference (Textbooks, Papers, Standards)
🛠️ Technical Documentation (APIs, Protocols, Guides)
```

### **Quality Thresholds:**
- **Canonical Sources**: Authoritative textbooks, papers, standards
- **High-Authority**: Peer-reviewed, well-cited sources  
- **Domain-Specific**: Industry best practices, expert knowledge
- **Foundational**: Concepts that benefit ALL users

**Start uploading! Your foundation will immediately benefit every user.** 🚀
