# üöÄ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST
## 5 HOURS TO LAUNCH!

### ‚úÖ Changes Applied to pipeline.py:

#### 1. **Dynamic File Size Limits** (lines ~650)
- [x] Added `get_dynamic_limits()` function
- [x] Small files (<1MB): 3 chunks, 200 concepts
- [x] Medium files (1-5MB): 5 chunks, 500 concepts  
- [x] Large files (>5MB): 8 chunks, 800 concepts

#### 2. **Consensus-First Quality Control** (lines ~170)
- [x] Triple consensus = HIGHEST TRUTH (always accepted)
- [x] Double consensus = HIGH TRUTH (score ‚â• 0.5)
- [x] Database boosted = score ‚â• 0.8
- [x] Single method = score ‚â• 0.9 only

#### 3. **User-Friendly 50 Concept Cap** (line ~287)
- [x] MAX_USER_FRIENDLY_CONCEPTS = 50
- [x] Applied after natural quality cutoff

#### 4. **Enhanced Auto-Prefill** (line ~350)
- [x] Now includes TRIPLE_CONSENSUS and DOUBLE_CONSENSUS
- [x] Only high-quality concepts added to database

### üìã Pre-Launch Testing:

1. **Run Backup** (CRITICAL!)
   ```
   backup_pipeline.bat
   ```

2. **Test Pipeline**
   ```
   python test_production_pipeline.py
   ```

3. **Expected Results:**
   - Processing time: <30s for small files
   - Final concepts: ‚â§50
   - Consensus concepts prioritized
   - Dynamic limits working

### üéØ Performance Expectations:

| File Size | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| <1MB | 105 concepts, 55s | ~30-40 concepts, 20-30s |
| 1-5MB | 150+ concepts, 80s | ~40-50 concepts, 40s |
| >5MB | 200+ concepts, 120s | ~50 concepts, 60s |

### üîç Monitoring:

After deployment, track performance:
```
python production_monitor.py report
```

### üö® Rollback Plan:

If anything goes wrong:
```
cd ${IRIS_ROOT}
copy backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS\pipeline_backup.py ingest_pdf\pipeline.py
python run_stable_server.py
```

### ‚úÖ Final Verification:

- [ ] Backup created
- [ ] Test script passes
- [ ] Server restarts cleanly
- [ ] First upload works
- [ ] Concepts ‚â§ 50
- [ ] Processing time improved

### üéâ READY FOR PRODUCTION!

Remember:
- Start with the 50-concept cap (safest change)
- Monitor the first few uploads closely
- The system will learn and improve with each document

**You've got this! 4 days of pipeline issues are about to end!** üöÄ
