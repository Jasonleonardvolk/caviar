# INGEST-BUS → INGEST_BUS REFACTORING COMPLETE ✅

## Summary of All Changes Made

### 1. Directory Rename
- **Renamed**: `ingest-bus/` → `ingest_bus/`
- **Reason**: Python doesn't allow hyphens in package names

### 2. Files Updated

#### Batch/Shell Scripts:
- ✅ `start-ingest-bus.bat` → Renamed to `start_ingest_bus.bat` and updated path
- ✅ `start-ingest-bus.sh` → Renamed to `start_ingest_bus.sh` and updated path/logs
- ✅ `ingest_bus/start-ingest-bus.bat` → Renamed to `start_ingest_bus.bat` and updated echo messages
- ✅ `ingest_bus/start-enhanced-worker.bat` → Renamed to `start_enhanced_worker.bat`
- ✅ `ingest_bus/start-video-system.bat` → Renamed to `start_video_system.bat`

#### Configuration Files:
- ✅ `grafana/ingest-bus-dashboard.json` → Renamed to `ingest_bus_dashboard.json` and updated tags
- ✅ `prometheus/ingest-bus-alerts.yml` → Renamed to `ingest_bus_alerts.yml` and updated group name and job selector

#### Documentation:
- ✅ `ingest_bus/README.md` → Updated architecture diagram from `ingest-bus/` to `ingest_bus/`
- ✅ `registry/mcp/ingest.schema.yaml` → Updated description and comments

#### Log Directory:
- ✅ `logs/ingest-bus/` → Renamed to `logs/ingest_bus/`

### 3. Import Path Fixes (Previous Session)
- ✅ `ingest_pdf/pipeline/router.py` → Changed imports from `ingest-bus` to `ingest_bus`
- ✅ `unified_pipeline_example.py` → Added PYTHONPATH fix

### 4. Compatibility Shim Added
Created `ingest_bus/__init__.py` with backward compatibility:
```python
# Allow old "ingest-bus" imports to work
sys.modules['ingest-bus'] = sys.modules[__name__]
```

This ensures that any code using:
- `import importlib; importlib.import_module("ingest-bus")`
- Dynamic imports with the old name
- External dependencies expecting the old name

...will continue to work without modification.

### 5. Search Results Summary
Total occurrences of "ingest-bus" found and fixed: **15**
- File/directory names: 7
- File content references: 8

### 6. What Was NOT Changed
- Docker files: No references to "ingest-bus" found
- Python setup files: No package-specific setup.py found for ingest_bus
- CI/CD configs: None found referencing the old name

## Testing Checklist

Run these commands to verify everything works:

```bash
# Test imports
python -c "import ingest_bus; print('✅ Direct import works')"
python -c "import importlib; importlib.import_module('ingest-bus'); print('✅ Compatibility import works')"

# Test the unified pipeline
python test_imports.py
python unified_pipeline_example.py

# Search for any remaining references
grep -r "ingest-bus" . --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=__pycache__
```

## Migration Guide for Team

### For Python Code:
```python
# Old (will still work due to compatibility shim)
from ingest-bus.audio import ingest_audio

# New (preferred)
from ingest_bus.audio import ingest_audio
```

### For Scripts/Configs:
- Update any paths from `ingest-bus/` to `ingest_bus/`
- Update any log paths from `logs/ingest-bus/` to `logs/ingest_bus/`
- Update Prometheus job names from `ingest-bus` to `ingest_bus`

## Deprecation Timeline

1. **Now**: Both names work, but `ingest_bus` is preferred
2. **Next Release**: Add deprecation warning for `ingest-bus` imports
3. **Future Release**: Remove compatibility shim

## Communication

Add to your changelog:
```
### Changed
- Renamed package `ingest-bus` → `ingest_bus` to comply with Python identifier rules
- Updated all references throughout the codebase
- Added backward compatibility shim - old imports will continue to work
- The old name is deprecated and will be removed in a future release
```
