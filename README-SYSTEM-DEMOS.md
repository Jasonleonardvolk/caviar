# ELFIN System Demos

This repository includes demonstrations of the ELFIN system's core components, focusing on phase synchronization, spectral analysis, and their integration into a complete system.

## Standalone Phase-Koopman Demo

The `standalone_phase_spectral_demo.py` script demonstrates the integration between phase synchronization and Koopman spectral analysis. This self-contained demo doesn't require the full ELFIN package structure.

### Features

- **Phase Synchronization Engine**: Implements Ïˆ-coupling for concept networks
- **Spectral Analysis Pipeline**: Koopman operator computation using EDMD
- **System Stability Monitoring**: Computes stability indices and identifies unstable modes
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Real-time coupling strength adjustment based on spectral properties

### Running the Demo

Execute the demo using the provided batch file:

```
.\run_standalone_demo.bat
```

### Demo Scenarios

The demo runs two scenarios:

1. **Baseline System**: A stable system with moderate coupling
2. **System with Instability**: Introduces coupling changes to demonstrate stability adaptation

### Output

The demo generates visualizations in the `outputs/` directory:

- `outputs/baseline/phases.png`: Phase evolution plot for the baseline scenario
- `outputs/baseline/metrics.png`: Synchronization and stability metrics for the baseline scenario
- `outputs/with_instability/phases.png`: Phase evolution with introduced instability
- `outputs/with_instability/metrics.png`: Metrics showing adaptation to instability

## System Components

### Phase Engine

The phase engine implements Kuramoto-style oscillator coupling with these key features:

- O(E+N) algorithm for efficient graph traversal
- Support for directed weighted graphs with phase offsets
- Real-time synchronization ratio calculation
- Matrix representation for mathematical validation

### Snapshot Buffer

The snapshot buffer provides efficient storage and retrieval of system state history:

- Fixed-size buffer with automatic capacity management
- Support for time-shifted matrix extraction for dynamic analysis
- Dictionary or array input formats for flexibility

### Spectral Analyzer

The spectral analyzer implements Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition:

- Koopman operator computation from snapshots
- Eigendecomposition to identify dynamic modes
- Growth rate and frequency calculation
- Dominant and unstable mode identification
- Stability index computation

## Dashboard Integration

The system can be integrated with the real-time dashboard:

- Server-sent events stream for health metrics
- Plotly visualizations for heatmaps and timelines
- Three.js rendering for 3D isosurfaces

## Usage in Projects

The standalone demo can be used as a reference implementation for:

1. Building concept synchronization systems
2. Implementing spectral analysis pipelines
3. Creating stability monitoring systems
4. Developing adaptive coupling mechanisms

## Technical Notes

- The implementation uses standard scientific Python libraries (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
- NetworkX is used for graph representation
- The code is compatible with both newer and older versions of SciPy (adaptive lstsq parameter)
