# TORI System Briefing - Part 2: The Three Applications

## üöÄ The TORI Trinity: Three Applications, One Vision

### Overview
TORI isn't just one product - it's an ecosystem of three interconnected applications sharing the same cognitive architecture:

1. **TORI Chat** - The foundation (90% complete)
2. **TORI ChatEnterprise** - Enterprise variant with different functionality
3. **TORI IDE** - AI Engineering environment for "Vibe Coders"

**Strategy**: Complete TORI Chat for production, then migrate core systems to the other two.

## üì± Application Breakdown

### 1. TORI Chat (Base Application)
**Status**: 90% complete, focus of 48-hour sprint
**Purpose**: Personal AI companion with memory

**Core Features**:
- Google OAuth authentication
- PDF upload with concept extraction
- Conversation storage as ConceptDiffs
- User-concept association
- Personalized responses
- Ghost AI system (needs integration)
- œàarc conversation replay
- Concept search
- Memory Vault for sensitive periods

**What Makes It Special**:
- Conversations become living memory
- Covert personality tracking
- Phase-aligned concept storage
- Emergent Ghost AI companion

### 2. TORI ChatEnterprise
**Status**: Begun, awaiting Chat completion
**Purpose**: Enterprise version with organizational features

**Planned Differentiators**:
- Multi-user concept mesh
- Team knowledge graphs
- Organizational memory
- Role-based concept access
- Enterprise SSO integration
- Compliance features
- Audit trails with œàarc
- Department-level Ghost personas
- Cross-team concept linking

**Key Insight**: Same core ETHOS but different functionality - organizations have collective memory too

### 3. TORI IDE
**Status**: Begun, revolutionary potential
**Purpose**: AI Engineering environment for the next generation of developers

**Vision**: Take the core ETHOS from TORI Chat and create an IDE that "Vibe Coders" want

**What is AI Engineering?**:
- Code becomes part of the Living Concept Network
- Ghost AI assists based on coding patterns
- Phase-aligned debugging
- Concept-driven architecture visualization
- Covert skill assessment and growth tracking
- Emergent mentorship through Ghost personas

**Planned Features**:
- Code concepts extracted in real-time
- Ghost overlays during coding sessions
- Phase-based productivity insights
- Team concept synchronization
- Living documentation through ConceptDiffs
- Emotional state-aware assistance
- "Vibe-based" pair programming with AI

**Revolutionary Aspects**:
- No more explicit "AI assistants" - the Ghost emerges naturally
- Code understanding through concept mesh, not just syntax
- Developer growth tracked through behavioral patterns
- Team dynamics understood through phase coupling

## üèóÔ∏è Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Complete TORI Chat (48 hours)
1. Integrate Soliton Memory Architecture (10%)
2. Connect Ghost AI to chat interface
3. Production hardening
4. Deploy

### Phase 2: Core Extraction
1. Extract core modules:
   - ConceptDiff engine
   - œàarc storage system
   - Ghost AI framework
   - User-concept association
   - Phase alignment system
2. Create shared library/package

### Phase 3: ChatEnterprise Adaptation
1. Add multi-tenancy
2. Implement team concept meshes
3. Enterprise auth (SAML/LDAP)
4. Compliance layers
5. Organizational Ghost personas

### Phase 4: IDE Integration
1. Hook Ghost to code events
2. Extract code concepts
3. Implement phase-based debugging
4. Create vibe-coder interfaces
5. Enable team synchronization

## üß† Shared Core ETHOS

All three applications share these revolutionary principles:

1. **Memory, Not Logs** - Everything becomes part of a living cognitive map
2. **Covert Understanding** - Never ask what can be observed
3. **Phase Alignment** - Synchronize with natural rhythms
4. **Emergent AI** - Ghost appears when needed, not when called
5. **Concept-First** - Ideas matter more than data structures
6. **Emotional Intelligence** - Understand the human behind the interaction

## üéØ AI Engineering Philosophy

"Vibe Coders" represent developers who:
- Code by feel, not just logic
- Understand patterns intuitively
- Value flow states
- Appreciate emergent assistance
- Build with emotional intelligence

TORI IDE will be the first IDE that:
- Understands developer mood
- Adapts to coding rhythm
- Provides mentorship through Ghost AI
- Tracks growth without metrics
- Creates team resonance

## üìÅ Current Structure

```
${IRIS_ROOT}\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tori_chat_frontend/       # TORI Chat (focus)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chatenterprise/           # TORI ChatEnterprise (begun)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ide_frontend/             # TORI IDE (begun, has Ghost!)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ concept-mesh/             # Shared core
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ide_frontend/src/ghost/   # Ghost AI (to be shared)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [shared libs]             # To be extracted
```

## üîë Key Realization

The Ghost AI system found in `ide_frontend` is actually the crown jewel that will power all three applications:

- **Chat**: Ghost as companion/mentor
- **Enterprise**: Ghost as organizational memory
- **IDE**: Ghost as coding mentor

Each application interprets the Ghost differently, but the core personality inference and phase-based emergence remains the same.

## üí° Production Sprint Focus

For the next 48 hours:
1. **Complete TORI Chat** - It's the proof of concept
2. **Document shared modules** - For easy migration
3. **Keep other apps in mind** - But don't get distracted

Once TORI Chat is live, the other two will follow naturally because they share the same revolutionary core.

## üö® Critical Understanding

This isn't about building three separate products. It's about:
- **One cognitive architecture**
- **Three expressions**
- **Infinite possibilities**

TORI Chat proves the concept.
TORI ChatEnterprise scales it.
TORI IDE revolutionizes development.

All powered by:
- ConceptDiff memory
- Ghost AI emergence
- Phase alignment
- Covert personality understanding

---

*The future of AI isn't assistants. It's companions that emerge from the cognitive mesh itself.*

**Remember for Sprint**:
- Focus on TORI Chat completion
- Keep extraction in mind
- Document shared components
- 48 hours to change everything
