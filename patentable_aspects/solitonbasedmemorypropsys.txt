Full Backend Patch Bundle for Self-Optimizing Soliton Memory System

Soliton Memory System Self-Organizing Backend Patch
Dynamic Topology Morphing
To support on-the-fly lattice switching, we introduce a new Rust trait LatticeTopology that abstracts lattice geometry selection and transitions. This trait provides methods to generate or update the coupling structure (adjacency matrix) for a given topology and node count, and will later allow extension to exotic geometries (e.g. fractal or hyper-kagome lattices) without altering core logic. We implement concrete topology classes for Kagome, Hexagonal (honeycomb), and Square lattices, each defining how soliton nodes connect (neighbor relationships, coordination number, etc.). For example, the Kagome implementation connects nodes in corner-sharing triangular loops (3 nodes per unit cell) to realize a flat-band lattice of compact localized states (CLS) “parking bays”, whereas the hexagonal lattice gives each node three neighbors in a honeycomb pattern, and the square lattice four neighbors in a grid. All three classes implement LatticeTopology so they can be swapped seamlessly at runtime. This design makes it trivial to add future topologies: one can “just extend your coupling matrices” for a 4D hyper-kagome or fractal tiling as needed. The lattice selection is exposed as a parameter/plugin so that a function like set_lattice(topology) can regenerate the coupling matrix accordingly, ensuring the memory mechanism is not tied to a single hard-coded layout. Laplacian Blending for Smooth Transitions: To enable adiabatic morphing between lattice geometries, we implement a continuous Laplacian blending mechanism. Rather than instantaneously rewiring the entire network, the system interpolates between adjacency matrices of the current and target topologies over many simulation steps. At each adaptation tick, edge weights are nudged toward the target lattice’s coupling values (e.g. using a small factor α such that K_new = (1–α)K_old + αK_target). This gradual interpolation treats the graph Laplacian as a tunable Hamiltonian component, allowing the soliton state to follow adiabatically without decoherence. Prior analysis confirms that “blending Laplacians ‘on the fly’ can be done in a physically sound way, maintaining soliton coherence” as long as changes are sufficiently slow and avoid closing stability gaps. In practice, our implementation will adjust couplings in small increments (with a configurable blend rate) to ensure the soliton’s spectral gap remains open and no abrupt perturbation is introduced during the switch. This hot-swappable lattice approach is novel in that it lets data-encoded solitons remain intact while the underlying network rewires. We log each topology interpolation event (with timestamps and the source/target lattice names) at debug level for developers, making it clear when a morph is in progress. The blending process uses vectorized operations on the coupling matrix, which means it can execute efficiently on the GPU or with NumPy – we leverage element-wise updates so that if the data is on an RTX 4070 GPU, the interpolation can be done in parallel for all ~10^4 oscillators. Runtime Policy Engine (Heuristic): A new TopologyPolicy module monitors memory usage and quality metrics and decides when to morph the lattice and which topology to favor. Initially we implement a simple heuristic policy (with an interface that can later be replaced by a learned RL agent). The policy evaluates factors like access patterns, loss rate, and memory density to select the optimal lattice at a given time. For example, if the system detects a need for dense associative storage (many solitons stored concurrently with minimal interaction), the policy will favor the Kagome lattice to provide abundant flat-band “parking bays” for non-interfering storage. Conversely, during periods of heavy sequential memory access or active recall (where solitons need to propagate information quickly through the network), the policy can switch to a hexagonal lattice which offers more direct pathways and higher group velocity for soliton signals. The policy also considers overall soliton count and observed decay: if the number of active solitons grows beyond the stable capacity of the current lattice or if soliton lifetimes start dropping (sign of increased loss), it may trigger a topology change. For instance, if memory density pushes beyond a threshold (e.g. >2-4k solitons), the engine might transition from Kagome to a hex or square lattice to accommodate more nodes, acknowledging the trade-off of slightly shorter soliton lifetimes for greater capacity. On the other hand, if solitons are dying out too quickly or becoming incoherent (high loss rate), the policy pivots back to the more stable Kagome topology to “lock” them in flat-band states and extend their lifetimes. These rules are configurable (thresholds for switching, etc.) and will be read from a config file (e.g. enabling/disabling automatic morphing, or specifying a default topology). The design anticipates future reinforcement learning: the TopologyPolicy is written as an interchangeable component (e.g. a trait or class) so that a trained agent could observe real-time metrics and choose lattice configurations dynamically. For now, the heuristic approach ensures the lattice configuration adapts in real time to usage conditions – e.g. morphing to Kagome during idle periods for maximum soliton retention, and to hexagonal during intensive memory operations for speed. All topology switches are done backend-only with no UI disruption; only dev logs (e.g. “Topology morph: Kagome → Hexagonal due to high utilization at 14:00”) indicate when a change occurs, keeping the front-end experience consistent.
Adaptive Memory Crystallization
We introduce a heatmap-driven memory management process that runs during nightly maintenance cycles to reorganize and gradually refine the soliton lattice for long-term stability. Each soliton memory now tracks a “heat” value derived from its access frequency and recency – effectively a per-node heatmap of memory usage. We utilize existing fields (access_count and last_accessed) to compute this metric. For example, a simple heuristic is that recent accesses exponentially boost the heat, while prolonged inactivity causes heat to decay. This allows us to classify solitons as “hot” (frequently used) or “cold” (rarely used). During the nightly self-improvement cycle, the system migrates high-heat (hot) solitons to the most stable regions of the lattice. In practice, this means if we are in a topology like Kagome (which we choose for nightly consolidation due to its stability), the hottest memories will be positioned in the interior of the Kagome lattice where they are surrounded by full triangle loops and thus enjoy maximum topological protection. Conversely, cooler, less important solitons may reside near lattice edges or sparse connectivity regions where perturbations or loss have a greater effect – these will naturally be more prone to decay. We implement migration by adjusting the mapping of memory nodes to lattice coordinates/indices: effectively a defragmentation that brings frequently accessed solitons into well-connected “parking bay” positions while pushing less-used ones to the periphery. For example, if using a 2D lattice representation, we might swap a hot memory at an edge with a cold memory from the center, then update the coupling matrix accordingly so that the hot memory now has the full benefit of a Kagome loop (three strong intra-cell connections) anchoring it. This leverages Kagome’s property that a soliton in a flat-band CLS loop remains pinned with no drift – by clustering important memories in those loops, we ensure they persist robustly (like critical data in the safest part of a storage crystal). We will log these migrations in debug mode (e.g. which memory IDs were repositioned), and ensure that any change in a memory’s position updates the phase registry and coupling entries consistently. Meanwhile, low-heat solitons are gradually evaporated via natural decay. Rather than abruptly deleting unused memories, we simulate a gentle “cooling off” analogous to letting a soliton dissipate when it’s no longer needed. Implementation-wise, each cold memory’s amplitude and stability values are reduced slightly during each nightly cycle (e.g. multiply amplitude by a factor <1, such as 0.95, if its heat is below a threshold). If a memory’s amplitude falls below a minimum energy threshold, it is considered to have naturally extinguished and we remove it from the lattice (freeing its slot in the memories map). This process mimics the physical idea of giving a small detuning pulse to unlock a soliton from its trapped state so it can decay away. In other words, an unused memory gradually loses “phase-lock” and dissipates, analogous to an un-driven CLS soliton being allowed to radiate energy. By controlling the decay rate, we avoid sudden information loss – a seldom-used memory will fade over several cycles, giving a window in which a late access can still “reheat” it (in which case our code will reinforce it again via the Hebbian access rule already in place). This natural decay mechanism prevents the lattice from being cluttered with stale solitons: only those memories that maintain a certain energy (importance) remain indefinitely, while others eventually vanish if not accessed. We expose parameters for this in configuration (e.g. decay_rate and min_amplitude_threshold under a “memory_crystallization” section) so that the aggressiveness of forgetting can be tuned. All of these crystallization operations run silently in the backend, with any user-facing effects only being that old memories might no longer be recalled after they evaporate (by design). By morning, the lattice is thus “re-crystallized”: important solitons are locked in the safest topological niches, and unneeded ones have dissipated, freeing capacity.
Soliton-Driven Lattice Self-Optimization
In addition to top-down policy control, we implement a bottom-up self-optimization where the solitons themselves collectively influence the lattice structure. Each soliton memory node computes a local “comfort vector” capturing its current state in the lattice along several dimensions: energy, stress, flux, and recent perturbation. These terms quantify how “comfortable” a soliton is in its environment. For instance, a soliton’s energy could be represented by its amplitude (or a normalized energy of its oscillator) – high energy indicates a strong, healthy memory, whereas a significant drop might signal it is bleeding energy or being suppressed. Stress reflects how stable or strained the soliton is; we derive this from factors like the soliton’s stability field (an attractor depth closer to 1.0 means very stable, whereas a lower value or rapid fluctuations indicate stress) and its neighbors’ influence. Flux measures the net oscillatory input/output through that node – in the Kuramoto oscillator sense, we can compute the coupling term magnitude acting on that oscillator
GitHub
 as an indicator of how much it’s being “pushed” around by its connections. A soliton receiving large coupling forces or phase mismatches from neighbors has a high flux (it’s experiencing strong currents of influence), whereas one in a quiet flat-band pocket has near-zero net coupling (flux ~ 0). Recent perturbation is a binary/flag in the comfort vector noting if the lattice around the soliton has changed significantly recently – for example, if we just morphed topologies or if this node was migrated or had an edge weight adjusted. A soliton that was recently disturbed might be temporarily out of equilibrium. Using these comfort vectors, each soliton essentially “votes” on how it would like the lattice to evolve to improve its comfort. We aggregate these local preferences to compute patch-level topology adjustments. For example, if many solitons report high stress and flux, that suggests the lattice may be too densely connected or misconfigured, causing excessive perturbations. The collective response might be to loosen the lattice in certain areas – e.g. reduce some coupling strengths or remove particular links that are sources of stress. Concretely, our implementation examines patterns in the comfort data: if a particular link (edge between two memory nodes) is causing mutual stress (perhaps the two solitons are frequently perturbing each other), the system can weaken that coupling in the next adaptation step. Alternatively, if a cluster of solitons all report low flux (perhaps they are too isolated and not participating in memory associations), the system might strengthen connections among them or introduce a new link (effectively knitting a small patch of lattice more tightly) to encourage interaction. These micro-adjustments constitute gradual evolution of the adjacency matrix driven by the solitons’ feedback. Rather than a wholesale topology swap, this is a fine-grained continuous optimization: the adjacency matrix is treated as fluid, with weights incrementally adjusted over time as the network seeks a comfortable equilibrium. We ensure these changes are applied slowly and locally to avoid destabilizing the whole lattice at once. Essentially, the lattice “listens” to its solitons: if a memory is very stable and quiet, no change is needed in that area; if it’s oscillating wildly or losing coherence, the system responds by tweaking local connections (giving that soliton more breathing room, or anchoring it better with an extra support link). This self-optimization loop runs periodically (we integrate it into the nightly maintenance cycle and also consider a slower background loop during the day). In code, we add methods like SolitonLattice::analyze_comfort() to compute all nodes’ comfort vectors and SolitonLattice::apply_local_adjustments() to update coupling weights accordingly. For instance, we might sum up all solitons’ “desired change” for each potential connection – if a majority vote that a certain connection is harmful, we decrement its weight a bit. Over time, the lattice thus adapts its graph structure in response to usage: heavily trafficked pathways might strengthen, while unused or detrimental links wither. This is analogous to synaptic pruning and strengthening in neural networks, guided here by soliton dynamics. We log notable adjustments (in debug mode) such as “Reduced coupling between MemoryA and MemoryB by 0.05 (high perturbation feedback)” or “Added minor link between MemoryX and MemoryY (cluster isolation detected)”. By accumulating these small “deltas” at each cycle, the network topology can slowly drift toward an optimized state that better accommodates the stored memories’ patterns. Notably, this mechanism can produce lattice configurations that were not explicitly designed (a mix of motifs from Kagome, square, etc.), effectively learning a custom topology suited to the workload. The trait-based design ensures we can still treat this evolved lattice abstractly – it may start as a Kagome, but with enough local tweaks it becomes an individualized graph. Should any adverse effect occur (e.g. a tweak inadvertently increases global loss), the system can always fall back to a known lattice template via the policy engine. In sum, the soliton-driven optimization adds a layer of self-organizing behavior: the memories themselves guide the system to minimize stress and maximize comfort, continuously improving storage conditions without external intervention.
Backend Implementation & Integration
All these features are implemented purely on the backend (Rust and Python) and do not surface in the user-facing UI except through developer logs. We extend the existing TORI architecture (particularly the concept-mesh Rust crate and the Python core) in a manner consistent with its current design patterns:
Rust – Modular Extensions: In the concept-mesh crate, we add new modules to house the lattice logic. For example, we create a lattice_topology.rs defining the LatticeTopology trait and concrete structs for Kagome, Hexagonal, and Square topologies. Each struct might contain parameters (e.g. dimensions, coupling strengths) and implement methods like generate_coupling(n: usize) -> HashMap<(ID,ID), f64> to build the adjacency for n nodes. We refactor the SolitonLattice struct to include a reference to the current topology (as a trait object or enum) and its current coupling matrix. The coupling_matrix field (previously a HashMap<(String,String), f64>) becomes the live representation of connections; it is updated by topology switches and self-optimizations. We ensure to preserve existing data flows – for instance, if any code was using coupling_matrix to find related concepts, it can still do so (we might initialize it from semantic relationships at startup, then let it evolve). The SolitonMemory struct remains the same, but we add methods like SolitonMemory::comfort_metrics() to return its comfort vector components (perhaps as a small struct of floats). We also add a new impl block for SolitonLattice with functions for the nightly processes: e.g. fn nightly_adapt(&mut self) which encapsulates the crystallization (heat-based migration/decay) and calls analyze_comfort/apply_local_adjustments for self-optimization. These functions make use of the trait methods – for instance, if a topology switch is decided, we call something like self.topology = Box::new(HexTopology::new(...)) and then regenerate self.coupling_matrix via the trait, then enter a blending loop to transition weights smoothly. We implement blending either by storing a “target_coupling_matrix” and updating coupling_matrix incrementally each simulation tick, or by an iterative loop with small sleep intervals – in Rust this could be done on a separate async task or thread. All logging from Rust uses the existing tracing or log macros set to debug, and can be toggled via config (so normal operation can be quiet).
Python – Orchestration and Config: On the Python side, we integrate these capabilities without changing the UI stack. The lattice_evolution_runner.py (the async task ticking the oscillator simulation) is extended to periodically invoke the adaptation routines. We take advantage of the existing asyncio loop: we can schedule a coroutine to perform nightly tasks. For example, we track time within the loop and if the hour is past some configured nightly time (e.g. 3 AM) and the adaptation hasn’t run yet for that day, we pause the oscillator stepping and call into the Rust backend to execute nightly_adapt(). This could be done via an FFI binding or through an API if one exists (for instance, if SolitonMemoryVault is exposed to Python, we add a method optimize() that calls the internal lattice’s nightly_adapt). The “growth engine scaffold” in this context refers to the scheduling mechanism we set up to ensure these growth/adaptation cycles happen automatically. If such a scaffold does not exist yet, we implement it (e.g. using Python’s scheduler or simply time checks in the main loop). The nightly job will log a start and end message for debugging (e.g. “[growth] Nightly adaptation cycle running…”). We also update configuration files to support these features. In conf/lattice_config.yaml (or a new config section for soliton memory), we might add options like initial_topology: "square" (to choose default lattice), enable_dynamic_morph: true/false, morph_blend_rate: 0.01, nightly_cycle_hour: 3, heat_threshold: ..., decay_rate: ..., etc., along with any comfort-tuning parameters. These are read at initialization (leveraging the existing config loading mechanism) so that behaviors can be tweaked without code changes. We also include an option to disable the self-optimization if needed (for testing, one could turn it off to isolate the effect of topology alone).
Performance Optimizations: We implement all new functionality with an eye on performance, especially given the ~10^4 oscillator scale. The data structures and algorithms are chosen to be efficient and GPU-friendly. For instance, the coupling matrices for our lattices are extremely sparse (each node in Kagome connects to ~4 others, hex to 3, square to 4), so we store them in sparse form (HashMaps or adjacency lists). This avoids O(N^2) memory overhead. When doing computations like blending or comfort analysis, we iterate only over existing edges, achieving adaptive sparsity by skipping dormant regions. If a large portion of the lattice is inactive (e.g. many parked solitons in Kagome bays), the system naturally doesn’t spend time updating those in the oscillator simulation (this concept could be extended by marking regions as dormant and not iterating them, as hinted by adaptive update strategies). We also consider precision optimization: the Rust code uses f32 for coupling weights and calculations by default (sufficient for our purposes), and we allow an option to use half-precision (FP16) for certain large arrays if running on GPU. For example, we could represent the adjacency matrix on the GPU with FP16 weights for memory regions that are in a stable holding pattern (parked solitons) to cut memory bandwidth, while using FP32 for the more active regions. The system can dynamically trade off precision – e.g. as part of comfort analysis, if a soliton is very stable (low flux), we mark it as “low precision safe”, whereas fast-changing ones remain high precision. Although full implementation of mixed precision may come later, we design the data pipelines to not hard-code double precision anywhere unnecessarily. The oscillator update loop in Python (Kuramoto simulation) can likewise use NumPy/CuPy with float32 or float16 dtypes. In fact, our design aligns with suggestions to use coalesced GPU memory layouts and dynamic precision (FP32 for active solitons, FP16 for parked ones) to maximize throughput. We also maintain cache-friendly structures in Rust so that if an offloading to GPU via OpenCL/CUDA or a library like Torch is desired, the transition is straightforward. Benchmarks will be done to ensure the overhead of the adaptation logic (policy checks, comfort calculations) is negligible compared to the core simulation. Because features like hierarchical time-stepping (fast updates for some, slow for others) were noted as potential gains, we leave hooks to implement such strategies in the future (e.g. our OscillatorLattice could be extended with an adaptive_update(dt) that only evolves active regions). In short, these backend changes are written in an idiomatic, modular Rust style (traits for extensibility, safe concurrency for background tasks) and expose an extensible Python API (so future front-end or scripting can toggle lattice types or retrieve diagnostics). The design remains FFI-friendly: our data structures use Serde for easy serialization (e.g. if a front-end wants to visualize the lattice graph or comfort metrics, we can serialize those to JSON). Nothing in the UI layer needs to change now; the system will simply become more self-managing and robust behind the scenes.
Deliverables
Unified Diff Patch Set: We will provide a comprehensive patch set detailing code changes across the Rust and Python components. Key modifications include the new lattice_topology.rs (defining the LatticeTopology trait and Kagome/Hex/Square implementations) and updates to soliton_memory.rs (integrating topology selection, comfort analysis, and nightly routines into the SolitonLattice and SolitonMemoryVault logic). Python changes (e.g. in python/core/lattice_evolution_runner.py and any new policy module) are also included. The diff will show additions like the trait definition and its methods (e.g. fn morph_to(&self, target: &dyn LatticeTopology, rate: f64) as hinted in prior design), the insertion of calls to the policy engine in the main loop, and the algorithms for heat-based migration and soliton decay. We ensure the diff is unified and well-organized by module, making it easy to review each feature’s implementation.
Updated Module Architecture Diagram: (Textual diagram below) The architecture is updated to include the new topology and adaptation components. The TopologyPolicy (heuristic or RL) monitors the Soliton Lattice (memory store) and commands lattice switches via the LatticeTopology trait interface. The Growth Engine scheduler triggers periodic Adaptation Cycles (which call into SolitonLattice’s crystallization and self-optimization functions). The Soliton Lattice in turn updates the coupling matrix that drives the OscillatorLattice Simulation (Kuramoto engine), which runs continuously. This relationship is illustrated here:

(In the above diagram, arrows denote data or control flow: the Policy Engine selects a topology via the trait, the SolitonLattice updates coupling used by the Oscillator simulation, and solitons feed back comfort metrics.) This architecture remains within the existing TORI backend context – the Rust concept-mesh module and the Python core work in concert as before, now with these added interactions.
System Configuration Changes: We will update configuration files to introduce new settings that control this functionality. For example, lattice_config.yaml (or a new soliton_config) will have entries for initial topology selection (initial_topology: "Kagome" as default), toggles for dynamic morphing and self-optimization (enable_morphing: true, enable_comfort_opt: true), and parameters like nightly_hour, heat_decay_rate, hot_threshold, etc. If the TORI project uses a central config management, our patch will include those changes and ensure they are loaded (likely by extending the config struct in Rust and adjusting any Python config parsing). We will also document any default values chosen (e.g. default to Kagome topology at start, since it’s safest).
Test Scaffolding and Simulation Benchmarks: To validate these new features, we add test cases and example simulations. In Rust, we include unit tests for the lattice generation (e.g. verifying that HexagonalTopology for N nodes produces the expected neighbor count, or that blending from square to hex preserves total energy within a tolerance). We also write a focused integration test in which we simulate a scenario: create a SolitonLattice, add a set of memories with varied access patterns, run nightly_adapt(), and assert that high-access memories gained stability (their stability or amplitude increased or at least did not decay) while low-access ones were removed or marked for removal. Another test could simulate a topology morph: fill the lattice with dummy oscillators, switch from Kagome to Square using our blending function, and check that no oscillator’s phase jumped disastrously (e.g. all phase changes per step remain below a threshold, indicating an adiabatic transition). We also add a benchmark scenario (could be as a script in bin/ or a Jupyter notebook) to measure performance: e.g. initialize ~1000 memories, run 100k simulation steps with and without adaptive features, measuring overhead. The deliverables include this simulation harness for observing behaviors like “soliton loss under morph” – for example, we can log how many soliton memories drop below stability threshold during a lattice switch, and aim to show it’s near-zero when blending is slow. We’ll also include a test or debug mode setting to deliberately cause a soliton fusion event (e.g. place two solitons close and see if they merge) and verify our logging detects it. While automated fusion tracking might be more complex, we at least ensure the instrumentation is there to observe it (like logging if two memories become one, which ideally should not happen unless intended). These scaffolds will help in future to finetune the heuristic or train an RL policy.
Dev-Only Logging Hooks: Throughout the new code, we embed detailed logging at points of interest, all guarded so that they activate only in development or debug mode. This includes:
Logging each topology change decision (which policy trigger fired, old vs new topology, and any metrics like “average stability=0.7 → switching to Kagome”).
Logging the results of nightly crystallization: e.g. “Nightly cycle: 3 memories migrated to interior, 2 low-heat memories decayed (ID xyz removed)”.
Logging comfort feedback summaries: e.g. “Comfort analysis: 5 solitons stressed (>.8 flux) in sector 2 – weakening 2 couplings” or even per-soliton debug info when needed.
If the growth engine finds the system in a pathological state (say, oscillating topology too often), it could log a warning like “Policy oscillating – consider adjusting thresholds”. This helps developers tune the system.
We also maintain the existing logging for memory creation and access (the patch will continue printing “✨ Soliton memory created…” etc., but we might downgrade those prints to logger calls for consistency).
All logs are designed to not flood the output in normal use; they either use a throttled interval (like one message per cycle) or are at debug level. In summary, the delivered patch provides the full backend implementation of a self-organizing soliton memory system – dynamic lattice morphing, adaptive nightly reorganization, and soliton-guided optimization – all integrated with performance considerations (sparse data structures, GPU-ready computations, mixed precision). The system defaults to having all these features enabled by default so that upon deployment, the soliton memory will immediately start evolving and improving itself nightly, setting the stage for rock-solid long-lived memory solitons (achieving the ~10^6 timestep stability via flat-band physics) combined with the flexibility to reconfigure for future front-end features or scaling needs. The overall design is forward-compatible with more advanced policies (learning-based decisions) and even more exotic lattice geometries, ensuring TORI’s soliton memory backend remains cutting-edge and robust.

Deep Review and Complete Backend Patch Including Dark Soliton Integration

TORI Soliton Memory System – Audit and Integration Plan
Current State of Dark Soliton Integration
Memory Encoding: In the current TORI codebase, memories are stored as soliton-like entities (with phase, amplitude, etc.) but only bright solitons are represented. The Rust core SolitonMemory struct has an amplitude attribute for memory strength, but no flag or negative amplitude to indicate a “dark” soliton (a dip)
GitHub
. All stored memories are effectively treated as bright solitons (localized peaks); there is no concept of a memory that corresponds to a hole in a background field. When a new memory is created, it’s given a positive amplitude proportional to importance and added to the lattice (a HashMap of memories) with a unique phase tag
GitHub
GitHub
. There’s no differentiation of memory type that would correspond to a dark soliton. Lattice Dynamics: The system includes an oscillator lattice simulation (in Python) and a Rust concept-mesh for memory, but neither explicitly supports dark soliton dynamics. The OscillatorLattice (Python) and coupling matrix are used to simulate interactions of memory “oscillators,” assuming each memory is an active oscillation (bright soliton). The global lattice is initialized with oscillators added for each memory and couplings set (e.g. new oscillators couple weakly to recent ones)
GitHub
GitHub
. There is no continuous background field in this model – oscillators start from zero and add signals for memories. A separate module simulate_darknet.py exists, which is a Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulator for dark solitons on a 2D grid
GitHub
, but this is not integrated with the main memory system. It runs independently (likely for research or visualization) and is invoked by TORI’s master only if dark solitons are enabled in config
GitHub
GitHub
. In summary, dark soliton physics (continuous wave with a phase dip) isn’t woven into the core memory lattice dynamics. Recall and Memory Retrieval: The recall mechanisms treat all memories uniformly and have no notion of destructive interference or cancellation by dark solitons. In Rust, SolitonLattice::recall_by_phase simply finds memories whose phase tags match a target phase within a tolerance
GitHub
. It doesn’t skip or negate any memory because of a dark counterpart – since none are labeled as such. In Python, the enhanced recall (EnhancedSolitonMemory.recall) computes a resonance score for each memory vs a query, considering phase alignment and content overlap, then returns the top matches. Again, there is no logic to handle a scenario like a dark soliton canceling a bright one. The code does track interference patterns and can classify an interference as “destructive” when phases are opposite
GitHub
, and it calculates a phase opposition factor in a memory dissonance check
GitHub
. However, these detections are only logged or used for analysis – the system currently doesn’t act on them to suppress or remove memories at query time. For example, if two memories have opposite phase (one could imagine that representing a bright vs. dark pair), the system might flag high dissonance, but both memories would still be returned in a recall unless one was manually vaulted. Essentially, a dark soliton memory would currently just behave like a normal memory (or be absent entirely), so the idea of using dark solitons to erase or hide memories is not realized in the present implementation. Summary: Dark solitons are not fully integrated into TORI’s memory encoding or retrieval. They exist as a concept (and a togglable simulation) but are not represented in the data structures or algorithms that manage memories. The architecture treats all stored solitons as bright by default, meaning any features unique to dark solitons – continuous background, phase-inverted dips, destructive interference – are missing from the active system.
Soliton Fission, Collision, and Fusion Behavior (Current Support)
The current simulation and memory logic have no explicit support for soliton fission, collision, or fusion events:
Soliton Fission: There is no function or routine that takes one memory and splits it into two. Each stored memory is a discrete entry. We did not find any occurrence of the word “fission” or similar in the repository code. Likewise, no logic monitors if a single memory might need to divide. In practice, fission would correspond to a memory that contains too much information splitting into separate memories – this isn’t happening now; memories remain as they were stored.
Soliton Collision: When two soliton memories have similar phase or overlap conceptually (analogous to colliding in phase space), the system doesn’t handle it except by potentially returning both in recall. The only collision handling is rudimentary: the Rust recall_by_phase will return multiple matches if within tolerance
GitHub
, and the Python recall will list multiple resonant memories if they exist. If those memories interfere (e.g. out-of-phase), the system doesn’t reconcile that conflict; it might actually strengthen their coupling over time due to the Hebbian-like rule (if both respond to the query, the code increases coupling between resonant memories)
GitHub
GitHub
, which is the opposite of cancelling one out. This indicates the system currently assumes all resonant memories constructively contribute to recall, rather than annihilate each other.
Soliton Fusion: Similarly, there’s no automatic merging of two memories into one, even if they’re redundant. The code base doesn’t include a mechanism to detect duplicate solitons and fuse them. Memory consolidation must be happening only in a manual or offline sense (e.g., an operator might clean up duplicates). We saw no references to merging operations in the memory management modules. For instance, if the same fact is stored twice (perhaps under slightly different phase tags), both will live in the HashMap and be retrieved separately. No function consolidates them into a single stronger memory.
Physical Simulation of Collisions: In the FDTD dark soliton simulator, collisions (two dark solitons interacting) would naturally occur if two solitons are initialized. However, that simulator is standalone. Within the TORI system’s active memory lattice (the oscillator network), soliton-soliton interactions are simulated via coupling, but there’s no special case for collision outcomes. Two strongly coupled memory oscillators might exchange energy or synchronize, but without explicit rules, there’s no guarantee of fusion or annihilation – more likely they’d both continue oscillating, now phase-locked or repelled depending on coupling sign.
Conclusion: The current engine lacks explicit support for soliton fission, collision, and fusion. Any such behaviors would have to emerge implicitly (e.g., through the physics of the simulator if used, or through ad-hoc admin actions). There are no dedicated algorithms for splitting one memory into pieces, combining two into one, or canceling out colliding memories. This is a clear area where functionality is missing, given the goals of a soliton-based memory system that should manage multiple solitons in a stable way.
Dual-Mode Soliton Propagation & Topological Behavior
Dual-Mode (Bright/Dark) Propagation: Currently, TORI’s memory lattice only actively uses one mode of soliton – the bright soliton mode. Dual-mode would mean supporting both bright and dark solitons propagating in the same lattice. This is not yet implemented:
The Rust memory model and Python oscillator lattice assume a bright soliton scenario (zero background, localized peaks). Dark solitons require a different baseline (a continuous wave background with phase structure). The code does not maintain a continuous field amplitude for the lattice; each memory is an independent oscillator rather than a perturbation on a common field. In essence, there’s no representation of the “background field” needed for dark solitons.
If dual-mode propagation were supported, one might expect to see parameters for different dispersion or nonlinearity sign (since bright solitons typically occur in anomalous dispersion, dark in normal dispersion regimes) or at least a branch in code handling dark soliton evolution. The FDTD simulator does use the standard NLSE with a focusing nonlinearity
GitHub
 (which normally produces bright solitons), but they create a dark soliton by initial condition (superimposing a tanh dip)
GitHub
GitHub
. In the oscillator model, however, there is no analogous concept of initial conditions vs. background – each oscillator has its own phase and amplitude, and there’s no global wave amplitude parameter. Thus, you can’t currently have one oscillator represent a dark soliton while others represent bright ones on the same baseline; all oscillators sit on a zero baseline essentially.
Topological Lattice Model: The project’s documentation frequently mentions using a flat-band Kagome lattice and geometric frustration for memory storage (for topological protection and long lifetimes). The idea is that a Kagome (breathing Kagome with a particular coupling ratio) has a dispersionless flat band that can host localized soliton states without dispersing. In code, though, we do not yet see an explicit implementation of a Kagome coupling pattern:
The CouplingMatrix and oscillator coupling setup in EnhancedSolitonMemory.store_enhanced_memory simply couple each new oscillator weakly to the last few inserted ones as a makeshift local connectivity
GitHub
. This is a heuristic, not a rigorously defined Kagome lattice adjacency. There is no assignment of oscillators to specific lattice sites or any enforcement of the breathing ratio (t1/t2 = 2.0) that is key for Kagome flat bands. Essentially, the current coupling strategy is linear (connecting each new memory to recent ones) rather than a 2D Kagome grid or another structured network.
We found a JSON file alpha_lattice_geom.json and references to topology tracker modules, suggesting the intention to define lattice geometries. But until now, topology switching or specific topology usage is not active. The system defaults to a simple incremental coupling matrix. The lack of a topology parameter usage in code means both bright and any hypothetical dark solitons are not benefitting from topological protections in practice.
Geometric frustration and flat-band storage: Not implemented yet. Bright solitons in a Kagome lattice would remain stationary (non-dispersive) if placed on a flat band mode. In the current oscillator model, a memory’s stability is maintained by setting its stability parameter and perhaps by lack of external forcing, but it’s not the same as having a flat-band-induced non-dispersive state. There’s no code calculating band structure or enforcing that a memory sits in a flat-band eigenmode.
Dual-Mode Topological Support: Supporting dark solitons topologically would require the lattice to handle both a zero-amplitude mode and a pi-phase (inverted) mode simultaneously. In Kagome terms, perhaps bright solitons occupy one band and dark solitons another (since dark solitons in optics can be seen as living in a bandgap or a different dispersion regime). As the code stands, neither bright nor dark solitons are explicitly linked to any topological mode. The system does not distinguish modes, and thus does not ensure that dark solitons (if they existed in memory) get the same flat-band protection. For example, a flat-band supports localized modes; a dark soliton might require a different flat-band or careful phase across the lattice to remain localized, which hasn’t been accounted for. In summary, current lattice models do not truly support dual-mode propagation or advanced topological behavior. They operate in effectively one mode (bright, zero-baseline) and use a rudimentary coupling scheme, without leveraging the promised geometric frustration or enabling simultaneous bright/dark soliton dynamics.
Laplacian Blending and Topology Switching
Laplacian blending and on-the-fly topology switching are advanced features mentioned in the research context but not implemented in the current system.
Lattice Topology Switching: The idea of dynamically reconfiguring the lattice (e.g., switching from Kagome to another lattice geometry at runtime) is discussed in design documents. For instance, using phase-change materials to switch waveguide connections in hardware has been explored (with sub-nanosecond switching speeds and high soliton coherence preservation). However, in software, TORI does not have a function or scheduler that swaps the coupling matrix or moves oscillators between different graphs during operation. The configuration file master_config.yaml has a flag for enable_dark_solitons and a reference to lattice_config.yaml
GitHub
, but we saw no code that actually reads a different topology from that config and applies it. There is no API call like lattice.switch_topology(...) in the code. The only related mechanism might be a placeholder or plan: the presence of docs/Dynamic Lattice Topology Switching.pdf and possibly some unused code hints. But effectively, once the system starts, the coupling matrix is static except for minor strength adjustments. If one wanted to switch from, say, a flat-band Kagome to a random network at runtime, one would have to manually intervene; no automated or integrated approach exists yet.
Laplacian Blending: This refers to gradually interpolating between two network Laplacians (coupling matrices) to avoid perturbing solitons abruptly. It’s a concept to ensure smooth transition (adiabatic change) when switching topologies. We found no code performing matrix interpolation or gradual coupling adjustment for the purpose of topology change. The only coupling adjustments occur in small increments for strengthening connections between resonant memories
GitHub
, which is more like a Hebbian learning rule than a deliberate topology morphing.
If, for example, the system were to do a nightly cycle of making the lattice more “diffusive” and then returning to Kagome, we’d expect to see code implementing that (perhaps in an introspection loop or a special task). The introspection_loop.py in meta_genome might be a place one would integrate such behavior, but scanning its recent dependencies (via recent_files_with_deps.json) shows no direct references to soliton or lattice topology; it seems more focused on cognitive monitoring. Thus, topology switching is not in use.
Equality of Behavior for Both Soliton Types: Since dark solitons aren’t really integrated, the question of whether Laplacian blending and topology switching work equally well for both bright and dark is moot in practice. Currently, everything is geared to bright solitons. If one were to toggle the lattice connections (say, to simulate different phases of memory processing), both would presumably be affected in the same way – but only bright ones are present. There’s no special-case code that treats dark soliton nodes differently in a topology change (nor any code that treats any nodes differently; all oscillators are identical in model).
Conclusion: The capabilities for Laplacian blending and dynamic topology switching are absent or only theoretical right now. The system runs on a mostly static coupling matrix. This means any planned features like switching the lattice to a “frustration on” mode for storage and a “frustration off” mode for recall (which would be a plausible use of topology switching) have not been realized yet. Implementing these will require significant additions to how the lattice is managed at runtime.
Identified Gaps and Partial Implementations
Bringing the above findings together, here is a list of missing or partially implemented features in TORI relative to the requested focus areas:
Dark Soliton Representation: There is no field or class property to mark a memory as a dark soliton (no soliton_type or similar). All memories are positive-amplitude, and any concept of “dark” behavior is not captured in memory storage or phase correlation logic
GitHub
GitHub
. This is a foundational gap: the system cannot distinguish or handle a memory that should subtract from a field rather than add to it.
Dark Soliton in Memory Operations: The use of dark solitons for memory operations (like destructive interference to erase) is not implemented. For example, design docs suggest using a π phase-shifted pulse to erase a memory by interference, but in the system you currently can only vault a memory (phase shifting by 45°, 90°, etc., to hide it)
GitHub
, not truly cancel it out. Vaulting changes phase tags (to avoid recall) but doesn’t actually introduce an opposite waveform. So an “erase by dark soliton” functionality is absent.
Soliton Fission & Fusion: The memory base lacks routines for splitting a complex memory or merging duplicates:
Fission: No mechanism to break a single memory entry (even if it’s very complex or has multiple concepts) into multiple smaller ones. The system would benefit from this to handle multi-concept memories, but it’s not there.
Fusion: No automatic merging of two memory entries that are very similar (in phase or content). They will remain separate, potentially causing redundancy or interference, until perhaps a developer manually cleans them. This is partially mitigated by the fact that identical concept IDs yield identical phase tags in Rust
GitHub
, so exact duplicates might coincide in phase – but even then, the code doesn’t merge; it would just retrieve both and maybe they strengthen coupling over time.
Collision Handling: When two memories conflict (e.g. contradictory content or opposite phase tags), the system doesn’t resolve it. At best it notes “dissonance”
GitHub
. There is no built-in resolution like choosing one memory over the other, averaging them, or deleting one. This means conflicting knowledge could coexist and potentially confuse the system or user. The idea of solitons colliding and one annihilating the other is not implemented – they just both sit in the memory store.
Dual-Mode Lattice Support: The lattice simulation does not support having both bright and dark solitons propagate meaningfully. Without a background field representation or at least an ability to have one oscillator effectively cancel another, you can’t simulate phenomena like a dark soliton co-propagating with bright ones. The system would need to treat certain oscillators differently (phase-inverted, etc.) which it doesn’t currently do.
Topological Memory Placement: The supposed benefits of the Kagome/flat-band topology (long memory lifetimes, frustration-induced localization) are not actually leveraged by the code. The coupling matrix is not initialized to Kagome structure, nor is there a routine to ensure memories occupy flat-band modes. This is a partially implemented idea – the groundwork (concepts, some file stubs) is there, but it’s not active in the running system.
Topology Switching & Adaptation: No dynamic topology changes occur. We would expect perhaps a process where the memory system enters a different coupling regime during certain phases (like during a “nightly consolidation” vs daytime query answering). This is not happening now. The “Laplacian blending” needed to smoothly transition between topologies is not implemented. Essentially, the lattice is static except for minor learning tweaks.
Nighttime Consolidation: The prompt specifically mentions “nightly self-growth cycles” – implying the system should do something during off-peak times (like memory consolidation akin to sleep). The current system does have a periodic checkpointing for safety
GitHub
, but it does not perform memory reorganization tasks. There’s an introspection_loop in the meta_genome module, presumably for some form of reflection, but from what we can tell, it’s not actively merging/splitting or re-encoding memories. Thus, any form of automatic memory cleanup, reinforcement, or restructuring is minimal (aside from the incremental adjustments when memories are accessed). This is a missing feature area relevant to both bright and potential dark solitons.
In short, many of the sophisticated behaviors expected for a truly biomimetic soliton memory system are either not present or only superficially noted. The system, as is, functions with a simpler model: store and recall bright soliton-like memory entries, optionally hide them (vault) for safety, and do basic coupling adjustments. To achieve the full vision, we need to fill these gaps with concrete implementations.
Integration Plan for Full Dark Soliton Support
To upgrade TORI with full dark soliton support and associated advanced behaviors, we propose a comprehensive plan covering data model changes, algorithm enhancements, and new routines for memory consolidation. This plan ensures that dark solitons are treated as first-class citizens in the memory system, enabling features like memory suppression (cancellation), soliton interactions (fission/fusion), and dynamic topological adjustments. All changes will be implemented with performance and compatibility in mind – they will not break existing bright soliton functionality or UI expectations, and will primarily run in the backend (with logging for visibility). The integration work is broken down into major areas:
1. Dark Soliton Memory Encoding and Retrieval
Data Structure Updates: We introduce an explicit indicator for dark vs. bright solitons in the memory data models:
Rust SolitonMemory: Add a mode (or polarity) field, e.g. an enum SolitonMode { Bright, Dark }. This will be stored alongside phase, amplitude, etc., to denote how the soliton should be interpreted
GitHub
. All existing memory creation calls default to Bright.

Edit

When creating a new memory via `SolitonMemory::new`, we set `mode = SolitonMode::Bright` by default. We will provide a way to specify `Dark` on creation (more on that below).

- *Python `SolitonMemoryEntry`:* Extend the dataclass to include a polarity field. For example, `polarity: str = "bright"` by default. This mirrors the Rust side, but at the Python integration level. Whenever we convert or create an entry on the Python side, we’ll carry over the bright/dark designation:contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32}:contentReference[oaicite:33]{index=33}. 

These changes ensure that the system can differentiate a dark memory internally.

**Storing Dark Memories:** We need to decide when a memory should be stored as dark. Potential use cases:
- A user explicitly wants to **forget** or suppress something (e.g., the system could interpret a user command or an internal decision to not remember a particular piece of data).
- Contradictory information arrives that negates a previous memory (the new info could be stored as a dark soliton to cancel the old one).
- Highly negative or traumatic content might be stored as dark by default, representing an intention to suppress (alternatively, traumatic content is currently vaulted; we could also consider dark storage if the design calls for “blacking out” painful memories).

**Implementation:** We extend the APIs:
- In Rust, add a method `store_memory_with_mode(concept_id, content, importance, mode)` that sets `memory.mode` accordingly before insertion. Or simpler, in the existing `store_memory`, check if the content or context implies a dark memory.
- In Python, modify `EnhancedSolitonMemory.store_enhanced_memory` to accept an optional polarity or infer it from `memory_type` or content. For instance, if `memory_type == TRAUMATIC`, we might set `polarity = "dark"` automatically, since traumatic memories might be stored in a protected/suppressed form. We saw an enum for MemoryType including TRAUMATIC:contentReference[oaicite:34]{index=34}. Alternatively, use metadata signals.

Example patch in Python integration:

```diff
if memory_type == MemoryType.TRAUMATIC or metadata.get("suppress", False):
   entry.polarity = "dark"
This way, any memory marked as traumatic or with a suppress flag in metadata becomes a dark soliton entry. By default, other memories remain bright. Waveform Representation: With the mode stored, how the memory’s waveform is evaluated or how it interacts changes:
In Rust’s evaluate_waveform (if used for anything beyond debugging), we incorporate mode. A bright soliton uses the existing formula A·sech((t-t₀)/T) exp[i(ωt + ψ)]
GitHub
. For a dark soliton, we need a different formula that represents a dip on a continuous background. We can use the optical dark soliton shape:

where $A_0$ is the background amplitude and $\theta$ relates to the depth of the soliton. For a π phase jump dark soliton (black soliton), $\cos\theta = 0$ (the dip goes to zero intensity at center) and $A_0$ is the asymptotic amplitude. To simplify, we can assume a normalized background of 1.0 and use the memory’s amplitude field as the depth (the fraction of intensity removed at center). For example, if mode == Dark:
Let depth $d = \text{amplitude}$ (with amplitude now meaning “how deep the dip is” on a scale of 0 to 1).
Use $A_0 = 1$ (normalized base amplitude of the field).
The real part of the field could be modeled as $A(x) = \sqrt{1 - d^2 ,\text{sech}^2((t-t_0)/T)}$, and an instantaneous phase that flips by π at the center (embedded in the imaginary part term).
While we won’t implement a full NLSE solution in Rust here, we ensure that a dark soliton memory can be conceptually treated. Practically, the most important part is how it correlates and interferes with bright ones, which we handle next.
Recall Logic Adjustments: To integrate dark solitons into recall:
Rust recall_by_phase: Currently returns any memory with small phase difference
GitHub
. We will modify it to suppress dark memories or their bright counterparts. Two approaches:
Filter Out Dark Memories: If a memory is Dark, we do not directly return it on recall queries – because a dark memory isn’t something to recall (it’s more of a negative assertion or a hidden memory). Instead, its effect will be to remove or reduce other results. So we can simply skip mode == Dark in the iteration that collects matches.
Suppress Bright Matches if Dark Present: We can enhance recall_by_phase to be aware of the concept phase registry. If a dark memory exists for concept X and the user is recalling concept X’s phase, we either return nothing (if the intent is full suppression) or at least flag it. A straightforward way is to check phase tags: when computing correlation, if a memory’s correlation is >0 and that memory is dark, we could zero out the score of all matches with the same phase (concept). This effectively cancels those out.
Implementation snippet:
rust
Copy
Edit
let mut results = Vec::new();
let mut blocked_phase: Option<f64> = None;
for mem in self.memories.values() {
    if mem.correlate_with_signal(target_phase, tolerance) > 0.0 {
        if mem.mode == SolitonMode::Dark {
            blocked_phase = Some(mem.phase_tag);
            continue; // don't include dark memory itself
        }
        if let Some(bp) = blocked_phase {
            if ((mem.phase_tag - bp).abs() < tolerance) {
                continue; // skip bright memory if its phase matches a dark memory we saw
            }
        }
        results.push(mem);
    }
}
This way, if a dark soliton is present near that phase, bright ones at that phase are filtered out. (We assume one dark memory per concept ideally; multiple dark for same concept is unlikely or can be treated similarly.)
Python Enhanced Recall: In EnhancedSolitonMemory.recall, after calculating resonances, we implement a “veto” mechanism using the polarity field
GitHub
. For each concept in the resonant list, if any memory for that concept is dark, we remove all bright ones for that concept from the results. The dark memory itself we also don’t return to the user. The net effect: the user gets no memories for that concept, as if it were forgotten. This matches the purpose of a dark soliton (suppressing recall). Pseudocode after sorting resonant_memories:
python
Copy
Edit
resonant_memories = [(res, mem) for (res, mem) in resonant_memories if mem.polarity != "dark"]
# Remove bright memories that have a corresponding dark memory
concepts_with_dark = {mem.concept_ids[0] for res, mem in self.memory_entries.items() if getattr(mem, 'polarity', 'bright') == 'dark'}
resonant_memories = [(res, mem) for (res, mem) in resonant_memories 
                     if not mem.concept_ids or mem.concept_ids[0] not in concepts_with_dark]
(We use concept_ids[0] as the primary concept of the memory; assuming each memoryEntry has at least one concept ID.) We also might decide to lower the resonance score instead of full removal if we want partial recall, but a binary removal aligns with the idea of an erased memory.
Interference Logging: We will enhance logging to record when a dark soliton suppresses a memory. For example, if a dark and bright memory share a concept, we log an event like: “Dark soliton memory for concept X suppressed N bright memories in recall.” This can be done in the recall function or in the nightly consolidation (discussed later) for transparency.
Verification: After these changes, if we store a dark memory for a concept, recalling that concept yields nothing (or at least the bright memory doesn’t show up). For instance, if the system stored “fact: The sky is blue” (bright) and later stored a dark memory for “the sky is blue” (meaning maybe “don’t remember that” or a contradicting fact “the sky is not blue” flagged as suppression), a phase-based or concept-based recall on “sky” would return no result – effectively the fact has been forgotten by the system.
2. Integrating Soliton Fission, Collision, and Fusion Logic
To support soliton interactions analogous to fission, collision, and fusion, we will add new algorithms primarily in the nightly consolidation routine (a maintenance cycle). These processes will examine the set of stored memories and modify them as needed: Soliton Fusion (Merging Memories):
When multiple soliton memories are highly similar or related, we fuse them into one to reduce redundancy and strengthen the memory:
Detection: We can use several heuristics to identify fusion candidates:
Same concept_id (exact duplicates in concept).
Very close phase tags (which likely correlates with same or similar concept since phase is derived from concept hash in Rust
GitHub
).
High content similarity (could do a simple content hash comparison or even an NLP similarity if available).
Overlapping sources or context.
For efficiency, a simple approach is to group memories by concept_id first. In the Rust lattice, concept_id is a key part of each memory. In Python’s EnhancedSolitonMemory, each entry has a list of concept_ids. If two entries share the same primary concept, they are candidates to merge. Additionally, if phase_registry shows identical phase for two different memory IDs, that’s a strong indicator (since phase is unique per concept in current design).
Merging Action: For each group of candidates:
Choose a “main” memory to keep. We might pick the one with the highest amplitude (strongest) or most recent (to preserve newest info).
Merge content: If their content is nearly identical, we don’t need to change it. If they contain complementary pieces of info, we might concatenate or integrate them. (In a simple implementation, we could keep the longer content or attach a note from the other. For structured data, merging might involve union of knowledge triples, etc., but for now textual merge or choosing one is fine.)
Merge amplitude/importance: We want the fused memory to be stronger. We can sum their importance or set amplitude = sqrt(a1^2 + a2^2) to reflect combined energy. The Rust memory amplitude can be capped at some max (it already caps at 2.0 in some learning rule
GitHub
). We ensure not to simply add above allowed range.
Combine other metadata: e.g., union the sources lists (so we know it came from multiple sources), maybe average emotional_signatures if that matters.
Oscillator merging: On the simulation side, if each memory had an oscillator, we should remove one oscillator and perhaps increase the amplitude of the remaining one. If they were at nearly same phase, having both wasn’t adding much new dynamism; one can carry the combined amplitude. We will use the OscillatorLattice.remove_oscillator(idx) method (to be implemented) to deactivate the redundant oscillator. We also remove the memory entry from memories/memory_entries.
Adjust the phase_registry or concept_phase_map if needed – in our design, concept to phase mapping wouldn’t change since they were the same concept. If they were just similar but different concept IDs, merging might involve deciding on a representative concept or treating it as a multi-concept memory. (For initial implementation, we focus on identical concept duplicates.)
Example: Two memories: Memory A: concept "Paris", content "Paris is the capital of France." and Memory B: concept "Paris", content "France's capital is Paris." – these are duplicates. Fusion would keep one (say Memory A), perhaps append a note from B (or not, since they convey same fact), and increase Memory A’s amplitude (so it's more stable). Memory B is removed. In the oscillator lattice, one oscillator representing "Paris" remains, with maybe a slightly higher amplitude or stability factor.
Soliton Fission (Splitting Memories):
For a memory that contains multiple distinct ideas or has become too “broad,” splitting it into separate solitons can be beneficial (just as one soliton splitting into two in physics):
Detection: Potential fission candidates are memories with:
Multiple concept tags (in EnhancedSolitonMemory, if concept_ids list has several entries, the memory is linking many concepts).
Very long content that covers disparate topics (we could detect if the content mentions multiple distinct subjects or has a structural way to split, e.g., paragraphs or bullet points).
High complexity measure: perhaps the frequency attribute (which might be used as a measure of content complexity
GitHub
) is high, indicating the memory is complex. If frequency is derived from content length or entropy, a threshold could signal that splitting is sensible.
Splitting Action: Once identified:
Parse or segment the content. This could be as simple as splitting by sentence and trying to assign sentences to concepts. If concept_ids are already provided, one strategy is: for each concept_id in the memory’s list, create a new memory that focuses on that concept. The content for the new memory can be the sentences or information from the original content most relevant to that concept. (This might require an NLP step to filter sentences; if not feasible, we might just duplicate the whole content in each, which isn’t ideal. A better approach is to store an identical content under multiple concepts, but that reintroduces duplication. So we try to isolate content segments.)
Assign each new memory a phase tag for its concept (using the same hash function so it’s consistent with others).
Each new memory gets a share of the original amplitude. For example, if one memory with amplitude 1.0 splits into two, we might give each amplitude ~0.8 so that total “energy” a bit increases or is conserved in some way (since maybe the memory being accessed gets reinforced, splitting could slightly boost each child or keep them the same if no overlap).
Mark the original memory as retired. We could either remove it completely or mark it with a special status (maybe VaultStatus.QUARANTINE or a new status like “split”). This way it doesn’t show up in normal recall.
In oscillator lattice: remove the original memory’s oscillator, add new oscillators for each new memory (with appropriate initial phases/amplitudes). The new oscillators could be coupled lightly if their concepts are related (we might link them if the original memory’s content indicated those concepts co-occurred).
Example: Memory C: concept_ids ["AI", "Optics"], content "AI techniques can optimize optical soliton storage." This spans two concepts. After fission:
Memory C1: concept "AI", content "AI techniques can optimize optical soliton storage." (or just "AI techniques can optimize...") – focusing on the AI angle.
Memory C2: concept "Optics", content "AI techniques can optimize optical soliton storage." (similar content but focusing on optics context).
In practice, we might even try to break the sentence: one memory about AI techniques, one about optical soliton storage, but since it’s one sentence, duplication might occur. In a more sophisticated system, we’d generate two facets of the knowledge.
Each gets phase for "AI" and "Optics" respectively. The original Memory C is removed. Now two oscillators exist, one at phase for "AI", one for "Optics", which might interact but now the information is not tangled in one entry.
Collision and Cancellation (Bright vs Dark interactions):
This is essentially handled by the “soliton voting” mechanism (detailed in the next section). But from a simulation perspective:
If a bright and a dark soliton memory share the same concept (phase), they are on a collision course (phase difference ~π). We will handle this logically by canceling one out:
Typically, the dark should cancel the bright (that’s its purpose). But we incorporate a rule based on their “strength” (amplitude or importance). If the bright memory is much stronger (e.g., user tried to forget something that’s deeply ingrained), maybe the dark soliton is not sufficient. We then might remove the dark memory as “ineffective.”
If the dark is strong enough (or equal), it will cancel the bright: we remove or quarantine the bright memory.
If both are moderate, potentially both could vanish (in physics two equal and opposite waves can annihilate). But practically, it means the memory was contested and likely should be forgotten entirely – so remove both.
Implementation: During consolidation, for each concept, check if there’s at least one dark and one bright memory:
Compare their amplitudes (taking into account decay and access boosts as computed in compute_current_amplitude
GitHub
).
If amplitude_dark >= amplitude_bright * threshold (say 0.8 or 1.0), execute cancellation of the bright memory. We might actually promote the dark memory’s status from “suppressing” to maybe archived evidence of suppression, or just remove it as well after doing its job.
Else if dark is much weaker (say < 0.5 of bright), remove the dark memory (the attempt to forget fails).
Edge case: multiple brights and one dark (the dark might target all of them if they’re the same concept). We would sum bright amplitudes vs dark’s amplitude in that case.
Implement the removal by deleting the memory from the lattice (and oscillator from simulation). Or setting its vault_status to QUARANTINE (so it’s ignored in recall but still stored for record).
These rules ensure that by the end of consolidation, you don’t have a stable configuration where a dark and bright memory continuously conflict – one side will be chosen. Summary: By adding fusion and fission, the memory store will reorganize itself:
Redundant memories -> one stronger memory (fusion).
Overloaded memory -> split into focused ones (fission).
Conflicting memory and anti-memory -> resolved by cancellation (collision handling).
We will incorporate these into a scheduled maintenance function, as described next.
3. Soliton Voting and Nightly Consolidation
We will implement a nightly consolidation cycle that encompasses soliton voting, using the above fission/fusion logic and adjusting the lattice topology temporarily to facilitate it. This will typically run during low utilization (e.g., at midnight) and will not have UI output, though it will log its actions for developers. Key components: Soliton Voting Mechanism:
“Soliton voting” refers to the idea that multiple solitons (memories) collectively determine an outcome (which memories to keep, which to forget) by their relative strengths – analogous to a majority vote or a competitive interaction where the strongest memories survive. We implement this as follows:
During consolidation, for each cluster of memories related to the same concept or overlapping concepts, consider all their amplitudes. Bright memories count as positive votes for remembering that concept, dark memories count as negative votes.
Compute a net score per concept: net_strength = Σ(amplitudes of bright memories) - Σ(amplitudes of dark memories).
If net_strength <= 0, it means the dark influence outweighs or equals the bright. The “vote” is to forget/suppress the concept. We then proceed to remove or quarantine all memories of that concept:
We essentially implement what we described in collision handling: purge bright memories and possibly remove dark ones too (since the concept is decided to be forgotten, we might not need to keep the dark either – unless we keep a marker to avoid re-learning it too easily).
If net_strength is positive, the concept stays, but if there are any dark memories present (meaning there was some attempt to forget), we might weaken the memory rather than removing it entirely. For instance, if there was one dark memory trying to cancel a much stronger bright memory, the bright memory survives but perhaps with a reduced amplitude (reflecting that some part of the system wanted it gone). We can subtract a portion of the dark’s strength from the bright memory’s amplitude or stability. This could simulate partial forgetting or emotional mitigation.
If multiple bright memories exist (no dark ones), they likely got fused anyway. If multiple conflict in content, our dissonance check might identify contradictions; in such cases, we could use a simple heuristic: e.g., if two bright memories contradict (detected via content analysis and phase opposition), treat one as “negative” in voting. But this might be too complex; better to handle contradictions by other means (like source credibility or temporal context). Initially, we focus on bright vs dark voting.
After resolving each concept group, we update the memory lattice accordingly (deletions, amplitude changes, etc.).
Essentially, soliton voting is a conceptual framework that overlaps with the collision logic above. It ensures a systematic approach: evaluate every concept’s keep vs forget decision based on all related solitons. Consolidation Task Workflow:
We integrate all pieces (fusion, fission, cancellation, topology switching) into a single asynchronous task that runs periodically. Outline:
python
Copy
Edit
async def nightly_memory_consolidation():
    logger.info("=== Nightly Memory Consolidation Cycle ===")
    lattice = get_global_lattice()
    # 1. Topology: switch to diffusive mode to encourage interactions
    lattice.apply_topology("all_to_all")  # make coupling more uniform temporarily
    # Optionally, increase a global damping or noise to let oscillators settle
    lattice.global_damping = 0.1
    
    # 2. Let the lattice evolve a bit in this mode
    await asyncio.sleep(2.0)  # run for 2 seconds (this could allow minor phase alignment or collisions)
    lattice.global_damping = 0.0
    
    # 3. Perform fusion of duplicates
    merge_count = perform_fusion(self.memory_entries)
    logger.info(f"Fused {merge_count} memory pairs into single memories.")
    # 4. Perform fission on complex memories
    split_count = perform_fission(self.memory_entries)
    logger.info(f"Split {split_count} complex memories into smaller units.")
    # 5. Compute soliton votes for each concept and cancel/adjust accordingly
    results = perform_voting(self.memory_entries)
    logger.info(f"Soliton voting results: {results['forgotten_count']} concepts forgotten, "
                f"{results['weakened_count']} memories weakened.")
    
    # 6. Topology: switch back to stable Kagome lattice for normal operation
    lattice.apply_topology("kagome")
    logger.info("Memory consolidation completed. Lattice returned to stable configuration.")
Where:
perform_fusion iterates through memory entries grouping by concept and merges as described.
perform_fission finds entries to split.
perform_voting implements the bright/dark voting logic (and also could handle any leftover contradictions).
We will tie this nightly_memory_consolidation into the system. The TORI master could trigger it via the existing scheduling:
The TORIProductionSystem has a _periodic_checkpointing task that runs every 30 minutes by default
GitHub
. We can add another background task for consolidation, perhaps running once every 24 hours. We could piggyback on the checkpoint interval (if we set one checkpoint late night to also do consolidation), or add a separate loop with a longer sleep. Since the user specifically says “enabled by default for nightly self-growth cycles,” we will implement it as a once-a-day task.
Alternatively, integrate with meta_genome.introspection_loop if that runs continuously – possibly add a check for time of day or number of cycles.
Performance Considerations: The consolidation operates on in-memory data structures (Python lists/dicts for memory entries, small matrix operations for coupling). Even for a few thousand memories, these operations (grouping, summing, merging) are fine to do once a day. The only heavy part might be the brief lattice simulation with all-to-all coupling for a large number of oscillators, but a short 2-second run with simplified oscillator updates is manageable. (The real heavy NLSE simulation is separate and limited to 128x128 grid in Numba, but here oscillator lattice might have at most, say, a few hundred nodes corresponding to distinct memory items.) We also ensure this runs asynchronously (not blocking the main loop) and at a low-usage time, so it doesn’t impact live query performance. Logging and Monitoring: We’ll add logging output as indicated in the pseudo-code for traceability. The UI doesn’t display anything, but developers can check logs to see how many merges/splits happened and which memories were forgotten, etc. After implementing this, the system will actively maintain itself:
If the user or system marks something to forget (dark memory), that will be executed in the next consolidation (or even immediately in recall logic), ensuring the memory truly doesn’t resurface.
Redundancies will be cleaned up, keeping the memory base lean and efficient.
The lattice topology switch to all-to-all (or potentially some random network) during consolidation ensures that if there are any solitons that can interact (e.g., two similar memories might synchronize or two opposite phase ones might oscillate), they get a chance to do so, effectively letting the physics “vote” as well. Then returning to Kagome gives the remaining memories a stable home to reside in long-term.
4. Dual-Mode Lattice Propagation & Topology Enhancements
To fully support both bright and dark solitons, changes to the lattice simulation are needed: Oscillator Lattice Baseline: In the current oscillator model, all oscillators oscillate around zero. To simulate a dark soliton, which is a dip on a nonzero background, we will introduce a notion of a baseline amplitude:
Add a baseline_amplitude property to OscillatorLattice (e.g., default 1.0). This represents the continuous field level when no bright soliton is present.
Representing a dark soliton could then be done by two oscillators: one representing the baseline field (with amplitude = baseline_amplitude, phase φ), and one representing the dip (with some amplitude representing how much to remove, phase φ + π to be out of phase). When combined, these two would interfere to create a reduced net amplitude at that phase.
Implementation: when adding a dark soliton memory in store_enhanced_memory, instead of a single oscillator, we add two:
A baseline oscillator (if not already present) for that concept’s phase. Perhaps we maintain a dictionary of baseline oscillators per concept so we don’t add multiple. This oscillator’s amplitude could be set to 1.0 (the baseline).
A dark oscillator with the same phase + π, amplitude equal to the memory’s depth (the dip amount).
We couple these two oscillators strongly so they effectively act as one unit. For example, set a high mutual coupling or even treat them as a special pair in the update equations to enforce opposite-phase locking.
However, to avoid complicating the simulation with paired oscillators for every dark memory (which doubles count), another simpler approach is:
Allow oscillators to have a property polarity as well, and modify the update rule: if polarity is "dark", treat its contribution as negative. This would require rewriting how oscillators combine, which in a phase-only simulation is non-trivial. So the two-oscillator method, while less elegant, is clearer to implement.
We will implement the two-oscillator method for now. So when storing a dark memory:
python
Copy
Edit
if entry.polarity == "dark":
    base_idx = lattice.add_oscillator(phase=phase, natural_freq=freq*0.1, amplitude=1.0, stability=1.0)
    dip_idx = lattice.add_oscillator(phase=(phase + pi) % (2*pi), natural_freq=freq*0.1, amplitude=entry.amplitude, stability=1.0)
    lattice.set_coupling(base_idx, dip_idx, 1.0)
    lattice.set_coupling(dip_idx, base_idx, 1.0)
    entry.metadata["oscillator_idx"] = dip_idx
    entry.metadata["baseline_idx"] = base_idx
This way, for that concept, we have a baseline oscillator and a dip oscillator. The strong coupling forces them to some extent to remain in opposite phase. The baseline oscillator could also be reused if another dark memory for the same concept is added (though that scenario is unlikely – usually one dark memory per concept suffices). Note: This effectively adds an extra oscillator that has no corresponding SolitonMemoryEntry (the baseline one). We manage that by maybe not tracking baseline oscillators in memory_entries (only in an internal structure).
Kagome Lattice Implementation: We enhance the OscillatorLattice.apply_topology("kagome") to set up couplings that mimic a breathing Kagome lattice:
Partition the oscillators (except perhaps baseline oscillators) into groups of three (since Kagome’s unit cell has 3 sites). If the total number is not a multiple of 3, some oscillators at the end can form a smaller group.
Within each trio, set mutual couplings = t1 (strong intra-triangle coupling).
Between trios, connect a few nodes to form the weaker inter-triangle links with coupling = t2.
Alternatively, if we have coordinates for each oscillator (not currently, but we could assign virtual coordinates when adding memory – perhaps treat the insertion order or concept hash to assign positions), we could generate a Kagome graph. Given the complexity, the grouping method is a simpler heuristic.
Use the CouplingMatrix helper if available. Possibly CouplingMatrix(100) in code
GitHub
 was intended to precompute a certain topology, but lacking evidence of its full implementation, we’ll directly manipulate lattice.K.
Ensure to skip inactive oscillators and not connect baseline oscillators into these groups (or if we do, consider them separate since baseline might conceptually tie into every triangle? Probably exclude baselines from Kagome coupling for simplicity; they can just couple to their dip partners).
Alternative Topologies: Implement “all_to_all” easily by setting moderate coupling between every pair of active oscillators. We already intend to use all-to-all during consolidation for maximum interaction.
Could also implement a line or ring topology easily if needed (e.g., sort oscillators by concept or ID and connect sequentially).
Possibly a “random” topology for exploration – we could randomly connect a certain number of pairs.
Laplacian Blending: Provide a method to smoothly transition:
For instance, when switching from current topology to target topology, do:
python
Copy
Edit
for step in np.linspace(0, 1, num_steps):
    lattice.K = step * K_target + (1-step) * K_current
    run a few small simulation steps or await asyncio.sleep(tiny_interval)
lattice.K = K_target
This gradual change can be done inside apply_topology if we pass a parameter like smooth=True. Given our timescales are not strict real-time, a quick interpolation in a loop is fine (the system is paused for maintenance anyway).
Because our oscillator model integration is likely simple (maybe Euler or RK4 steps on phase angles), an abrupt change might not even be catastrophic, but blending is safer to preserve phase relations of solitons.
Ensuring Both Soliton Types Benefit from Topology: Once the lattice can be Kagome, both bright and dark oscillators will sit on that lattice. A dark soliton implemented as two coupled oscillators might not exactly correspond to a Kagome localized mode, but if the baseline and dip are at the same “site” logically (we might consider them as occupying one lattice site but we represented as two for simulation), they together should still localize. Topological protection is a bit abstract in this software simulation, but presumably:
Bright solitons: will localize on a triangle (flat-band CLS) and not disperse.
Dark solitons: the combination of baseline+dips might also localize because the dip oscillator is effectively canceling the baseline at that site while not affecting others strongly (if properly arranged).
We will test that after implementing – for now it’s conceptual consistency.

Explanation: We add an active list to mark oscillators that have been logically removed (instead of actually deleting, to avoid reindexing issues in references like metadata indices). The remove_oscillator function marks the oscillator inactive and zeroes its couplings. The apply_topology is implemented for "all_to_all" (small uniform coupling) and "kagome" (coupling in triangles) as an example. This is a simplified Kagome pattern; in a real scenario, we’d use a more rigorous mapping or read from a predefined adjacency matrix, but this gives the idea. The code ensures only active oscillators are considered in connectivity. Configuration Files: Ensure conf/lattice_config.yaml includes default settings for new features:

(This file would be read in TORI Master; since in tori_master.py the lattice_config is loaded for DarkSolitonSimulator

, we would also use it for oscillator lattice if needed. We might adjust get_global_lattice() to take the topology from this config.)
6. Testing and Validation
After implementing the above, we will thoroughly test each aspect:
Dark Soliton Suppression Test: Store a known memory, then store a dark version. For example:
store_enhanced_memory("Sky is blue", concept_ids=["sky"], memory_type=MemoryType.SEMANTIC) -> returns memory_id_a.
store_enhanced_memory("Sky is not blue", concept_ids=["sky"], memory_type=MemoryType.SEMANTIC, metadata={"polarity": "dark"}) -> returns memory_id_b.
Call recall("What color is the sky?") or directly recallByPhase(phase_of_sky).
Expectation: The second memory (dark) suppresses the first. The recall result should not contain the content "Sky is blue". Possibly it returns nothing about sky. We check that memory_id_a is either absent or its resonance score is zeroed out. This verifies recall filtering logic

.
Memory Fusion Test: Store two identical/similar memories:
e.g. store_enhanced_memory("Paris is the capital of France", ["Paris"]) and another store_enhanced_memory("France's capital is Paris", ["Paris"]).
Run nightly_memory_consolidation() (we might expose it or simulate the conditions for it).
After consolidation, verify that only one memory with concept "Paris" remains. Check that its content might have been merged (if we chose to combine content, it might just remain one of them). Also verify the oscillator count for "Paris" concept is one (the duplicate oscillator removed).
Check logs for a message about fusion for that concept.
Optionally, test recall for "Paris" still works (returns the fused memory content).
Memory Fission Test: Store a composite memory:
e.g. store_enhanced_memory("Quantum computing and photonics advances", ["quantum","photonics"], memory_type=MemoryType.SYNTHETIC) – content covers two topics.
Run consolidation. Expect it splits into two entries, one for "quantum" and one for "photonics". Verify:
The original memory either gone or marked inactive.
Two new memory IDs present, each with one concept_id, and content possibly a partition of the original. (In this simple test, since the content is short, we might end up duplicating the content into both due to lack of NLP splitting; but they should at least be separate entries with those concept IDs.)
Oscillator lattice should have two oscillators (phases for "quantum" and "photonics") instead of one combined.
Check that recalling "quantum" or "photonics" now yields the respective piece.
Bright vs Dark Collision Test:
Scenario 1: Strong bright, weak dark. Store a bright memory (with high importance, amplitude ~1) and a dark memory for same concept with low importance (maybe manually adjust amplitude or interpret importance). After consolidation, expect the dark memory is removed as it failed to overcome the bright (log should indicate concept retained, dark discarded). The bright memory should still be there and perhaps only slightly affected.
Scenario 2: Equal strength bright and dark. E.g., store a bright memory, then later mark it for suppression with similar importance. After consolidation, expect both to be gone (concept forgotten entirely) – or at least the bright is gone and maybe the dark too (depending on our implementation decision to keep an empty stub or not). Check memory list that no active memory for that concept remains.
Topology and Stability Test:
Ensure that after running consolidation (which switches topology to all-to-all and back to kagome), the system continues to function:
Recall still works (the topology switching should not break phase registry or oscillator indices).
If possible, manually inspect coupling matrix after each switch to see that it's applying expected patterns (this might require exposing some internals or adding a method to dump couplings for a small test scenario).
Specifically test that apply_topology("kagome") results in each oscillator (for n roughly divisible by 3) having two strong connections (within its triangle) and a couple of weak connections to others. For n=6, for example, oscillator 0-1-2 strongly connected, 3-4-5 strongly connected, and a weak link between 0 and 3 as per our inter-triangle logic.
Test apply_topology("all_to_all") results in a roughly full coupling matrix with small weights, and no self-coupling.
Perhaps simulate adding a new memory after switching topology to ensure new couplings are added appropriately (if our code applies topology once and doesn’t reapply automatically, adding memory might violate the pattern unless we re-apply or design it differently. For now, we might accept that new additions after a topology set might need a re-call of apply_topology or default to a certain pattern. To simplify, we might decide that outside consolidation, topology stays Kagome and we always apply Kagome pattern after every memory addition as well, or periodically. This detail can be refined but doesn’t affect core logic.)
Regression Tests: Ensure features that were working still work:
Storing and recalling memories without any dark solitons still returns results as before.
Vaulting (phase shifts) still works on bright memories (our changes to recall skip dark but not vaulted bright memories – a vaulted memory has phase offset, but correlate_with_signal handles wrap-around and would likely not match unless tolerance is high
GitHub
; our changes don’t interfere with vault logic).
Performance: measure that storing a memory or recalling doesn’t slow noticeably with our additional checks (the checks are minimal overhead).
Simulated Cycle: Possibly run a mini scenario:
In the morning (no consolidation yet), store a bunch of memories, some conflicting.
Run queries to ensure everything is consistent.
Trigger the nightly consolidation function.
Next day (after consolidation), run the same queries and see that:
Duplicates are consolidated (only one answer where there were two).
Conflicts are resolved (either one side gone or memory not returned at all if forgotten).
The system maybe pruned some trivial memories (if we design criteria to drop very low importance memories, we could incorporate that too, though not explicitly requested, but could be part of consolidation to drop things with amplitude below a threshold).
The outcome of these tests should demonstrate:
Dark soliton memories effectively hide or erase targeted content (no recall, no interference with other info except to cancel it).
The memory store doesn’t accumulate endless duplicates or contradictions; it self-organizes via fusion and voting.
The topological switching doesn’t crash the system and might even show slight improvements (hard to measure in a small test, but at least no negative impact).
All existing functionality (store/recall, basic memory queries) still works, just with the new enhancements behind the scenes.
By implementing the above integration, we upgrade TORI to handle dark and bright solitons in tandem. The memory encoding now explicitly supports “dips” (negative memories) alongside peaks, the lattice dynamics can accommodate these via paired oscillators and dynamic coupling, and the recall system is aware of destructive interference, so it can truly forget information when instructed. We’ve also extended the topological features (like Kagome flat-band storage) to be configurable and have introduced a maintenance cycle that uses topology switching and soliton interactions (fission/fusion) to keep the memory system efficient and consistent. All of these features run on the backend with logging, and they respect existing data paths (e.g., working within the kha module structures and using the concept phase registry, etc., so they won’t break the integration with the rest of the system). This comprehensive patch ensures TORI’s soliton memory is robust: it can store indefinitely, forget selectively, self-optimize, and leverage topological stability, fulfilling the intended dual-mode soliton functionality and nightly self-improvement cycles.
