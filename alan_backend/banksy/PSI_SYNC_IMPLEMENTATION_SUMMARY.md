   - Support for stability zones with configurable thresholds

2. **Koopman Integration (`psi_koopman_integration.py`)**
   - PsiKoopmanIntegrator: Connects eigenfunction analysis with phase monitoring
   - Visualization tools for stability assessment and predicted evolution
   - Synthetic time series generation for testing

3. **ALAN Bridge (`alan_psi_sync_bridge.py`)**

   - Adaptive coupling strength adjustments
   - Continuous monitoring and feedback

## Usage Examples

The system includes three primary usage patterns:

1. **Basic PsiSyncMonitor**
   ```python
   monitor = get_psi_sync_monitor()
   state = PsiPhaseState(theta=phases, psi=psi_values, concept_ids=concepts)
   metrics = monitor.evaluate(state)
   action = monitor.recommend_action(metrics, state)
   ```

2. **ALAN Integration**
   ```python
   bridge = get_alan_psi_bridge()
   state, confidence, recommendation = bridge.check_concept_stability(
       phases=phases, psi_values=psi_values, concept_ids=concepts
   )
   if bridge.should_request_clarification():
       # Ask for user input
   ```

3. **Koopman Integration**
   ```python
   integrator = PsiKoopmanIntegrator()
   eigenmodes, metrics = integrator.process_time_series(time_series)
   if not metrics.is_stable():
       new_coupling = integrator.apply_coupling_adjustments()
   ```

## Next Steps & Future Enhancements

1. **Further Integration**
   - Connect to ALAN's reasoning modules
   - Implement phase feedback to concept store
   - Add integration with AgentOrchestrator

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Multi-attractor basin analysis
   - Transfer orbit detection between attractors
   - Critical slowing prediction for early warning

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Vectorized operations for large concept networks
   - Sparse matrix support for coupling
   - GPU acceleration for eigenfunction computation

4. **Extended Applications**
   - Dynamic reasoning path selection
   - Concept cluster identification
   - Self-organized concept mapping

## Running the Demonstrations

1. Run from the project root with the master batch file:
   ```
   run_psi_sync_demo.bat
   ```

2. Or run individual tests:
   ```
   python alan_backend/banksy/run_psi_sync_tests.py [basic|koopman|bridge|all]
   ```

## Conclusion

The ψ-Sync Stability Monitoring System provides a mathematically-grounded framework for ensuring cognitive stability in ALAN's operation. By combining phase oscillator dynamics with Koopman spectral analysis, it offers a powerful approach to monitor, analyze, and maintain the coherence of concept processing.
