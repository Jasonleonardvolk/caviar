- Context manager support

### ✅ 4. Creative-Singularity Feedback Loop - Complete
**File**: `chaos_channel_controller.py`

### ✅ 5. Banksy-Spin Integration - Complete
**Directory**: `banksy/` and `core/`

PSI-Sync Implementation:

### ⚠️ 6. Topology-Aware Memory (TorusCells) - Partially Implemented

While not explicitly found as "TorusCells", the topology awareness is integrated into:
- OriginSentry's Betti number tracking
- BraidAggregator's topological aggregation
- The persistent homology timeline concept is partially realized

**Recommendation**: Create dedicated `torus_cells.py` module to:
- Implement full persistent homology computation
- Track homology classes across coherence bands
- Assign braid-ids to topologically protected ideas

### ✅ 7. Observer-Observed Synthesis - Partially Implemented

The self-measurement concept is present in:
- OriginSentry's spectral history and self-reporting
- EigenSentry's metric broadcasting
- PSI-Sync's stability self-assessment

**Enhancement Needed**: Implement explicit metacognitive token generation where measurement hashes become part of reasoning context.
