# Code Optimization Summary

## Import Cleanup Results

Successfully removed all redundant and unused imports from `pipeline.py`:

### 1. **Collapsed Duplicate Imports** (~6 lines saved)
- Removed duplicate imports at the top:
  ```python
  import logging
  import sys  
  import os
  from functools import lru_cache
  from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
  ```
- These were already imported in the "Standard library imports" section

### 2. **Removed Unused Imports** (~9 lines saved)

#### From chunk_processor:
- `ChunkProcessor`
- `ProcessingConfig`
- `ExecutorType`
- `create_chunk_processor`

#### From concurrency_manager:
- `run_sync as run_sync_unified`
- `process_in_batches`

#### From utils:
- `safe_multiply`

#### From error_handling:
- `MemoryError as PipelineMemoryError`
- `TimeoutError as PipelineTimeoutError`
- `ErrorHandler`
- `error_handler`

### Total Impact:
- **~15 lines removed** from imports
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
- Only importing what's actually used
- Better IDE performance and clarity

## Combined Optimization Results

### Phase 1 (Previous optimizations):
- Removed CircuitBreaker: ~44 lines
- Removed async context manager: ~8 lines
- Removed legacy adapters: ~10 lines
- Cleaned up imports: ~5 lines
- **Subtotal: ~69 lines**

### Phase 2 (Import cleanup):
- Collapsed duplicate imports: ~6 lines
- Removed unused imports: ~9 lines
- **Subtotal: ~15 lines**

### **Grand Total: ~84 lines removed**

The codebase is now significantly cleaner while maintaining all essential functionality. Every import is used, there are no duplicates, and the code is more maintainable.
