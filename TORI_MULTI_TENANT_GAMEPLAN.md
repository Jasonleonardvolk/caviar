# 🎯 TORI MULTI-TENANT GAME PLAN

## 📋 **PHASE 1: FOUNDATION LAYER (IMMEDIATE - 1-2 WEEKS)**

### **Week 1: Admin Knowledge Upload**
- ✅ **Upload 50-100 foundation documents** (science, AI, business, tech)
- ✅ **Tag concepts with authority levels** (canonical, verified, expert)
- ✅ **Test concept search quality** with foundation knowledge
- ✅ **Document knowledge domains** and coverage areas

### **Week 2: Foundation Optimization**  
- ✅ **Quality control** - Remove low-quality concepts
- ✅ **Semantic clustering** - Group related foundation concepts
- ✅ **Performance testing** - Measure search speed with 10K+ concepts
- ✅ **Foundation API** - Standardize concept access patterns

## 📋 **PHASE 2: SOLITON-BASED MULTI-TENANT (3-4 WEEKS)**

### **Week 3: Soliton Memory Architecture**
- 🔧 **Extend Soliton Memory** for multi-user phase separation
- 🔧 **User phase isolation** - Each user gets unique phase space
- 🔧 **Foundation phase layer** - Admin concepts in shared phase space
- 🔧 **Phase-based search** - Query across user + foundation phases

### **Week 4: Three-Tier Soliton Integration**
- 🔧 **Private Soliton Layer** - User concepts in private phases
- 🔧 **Organization Soliton Layer** - Org concepts in shared org phases  
- 🔧 **Foundation Soliton Layer** - Admin concepts in global phases
- 🔧 **Unified search API** - Single query, multi-phase response

### **Week 5: Authentication & Phase Management**
- 🔧 **User authentication** - Login/signup with phase assignment
- 🔧 **Organization support** - Multi-user org phase spaces
- 🔧 **Phase security** - Prevent cross-user phase interference
- 🔧 **Admin dashboard** - Manage foundation phases

### **Week 6: Testing & Refinement**
- 🔧 **Multi-user testing** - Verify phase isolation works
- 🔧 **Performance optimization** - Ensure fast multi-phase search
- 🔧 **Security validation** - Confirm no data leakage
- 🔧 **Foundation inheritance** - All users get admin knowledge

## 📋 **PHASE 3: CORPORATE FEATURES (2-3 WEEKS)**

### **Week 7-8: Enterprise Dashboard**
- 🔧 **Admin analytics** - Usage patterns, concept coverage
- 🔧 **Organization management** - Create/manage corporate accounts
- 🔧 **Knowledge auditing** - Track concept quality and usage
- 🔧 **Foundation curation tools** - Easy admin knowledge management

### **Week 9: Advanced Security**
- 🔧 **Compliance features** - Audit trails, data governance
- 🔧 **Access controls** - Fine-grained permissions
- 🔧 **Data export/import** - Corporate knowledge migration
- 🔧 **White-label options** - Custom branding for enterprises

## 🎯 **KEY TECHNICAL APPROACH: SOLITON-BASED MULTI-TENANCY**

### **Phase-Separated Architecture:**
```
Foundation Phase: 0.0-1.0    (Admin uploads - ALL users inherit)
Org Phase A:     1.0-2.0     (Company A shared knowledge)  
Org Phase B:     2.0-3.0     (Company B shared knowledge)
User Phase:      10.0+       (Individual private knowledge)
```

### **Security Through Physics:**
- 🔒 **Phase isolation** prevents cross-user concept access
- 🌊 **Soliton wave interference** enables controlled knowledge sharing
- ⚛️ **Quantum-inspired boundaries** between user/org/foundation layers
