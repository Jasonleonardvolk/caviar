# TORI Gremlin Hunt - Fixed Issues

## Fixed Module Export Errors:

### 1. solitonMemory.ts
✅ Added missing `vaultMemory` export

### 2. conceptMesh.ts
✅ Added missing `setLastTriggeredGhost` export
✅ Added missing `updateSystemEntropy` export
✅ Created necessary stores for ghost state and system entropy

## Current Status:
- File changes ARE working (proven by "BYE BYE GREMLIN" test)
- Backend API is healthy and responding correctly
- Missing module exports have been added

## Next Steps:
1. Refresh the browser (F5)
2. Check browser console for any new errors
3. The chat should now work if all missing exports are resolved

## If Still Not Working:
- Check for more missing exports in the console
- May need to restart the dev server to clear any module cache
- Try incognito/private browsing mode to bypass any browser caching

## Key Insight:
The issue wasn't caching - it was missing module exports preventing the app from initializing properly. Each missing export cascaded into more errors, creating the "gremlin" effect.
