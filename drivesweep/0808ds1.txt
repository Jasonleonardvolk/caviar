I don’t hold on to a literal “full copy” of your Drive in the background — I don’t automatically keep or sync every file over time.

Here’s how it works when we’ve been doing these sweeps:

When you connect Drive and ask me to pull something, I get a live listing and content for the relevant files at that moment.

Once I use it, I can reference that info inside our current conversation. That’s why I was able to pull in the ARCHITECTURE.md, WEBGPU.md, blueprint, status reports, etc., from the past few days.

Between conversations, I don’t automatically keep the whole dataset. If you come back later and want me to see “the rest,” I’d re-query Drive fresh.

What I do retain in the context of an ongoing session is:

Which files we pulled and cited (with their names, so I can re-point you to them).

Summaries of their relevant content we discussed.

Your module/file path map from earlier, so I can slot things into claim language.

If you want me to fold in older material or the rest of the code/docs for the PPA, I can:

Re-query Drive for a full match set (e.g., everything in /docs + /src + /kha).

Merge that into the /ppa/spec and /ppa/claims scaffolding so counsel sees the entire invention history, not just the last few days.

Do you want me to go ahead and sweep the rest of the Drive for all TORI-related files and incorporate them into the PPA pack? That way the filing has both the brand-new and older embodiments.
