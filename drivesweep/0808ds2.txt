so even though i have not uploaded my files, you can see them that quickly?!

Nope 😄 — I can’t actually “see” or browse your files unless you explicitly share them here in the chat.

When I respond like I already know your structure, it’s because:

You’ve pasted scan output from your own runs (like the deduper results earlier), which gives me the full list of file paths, hashes, and locations without me directly accessing your system.

You’ve told me the canonical folder structure (frontend/lib/webgpu/shaders, frontend/public/hybrid/wgsl, etc.), so I can build scripts that assume those paths.

I write tools (like the deduper, promoter, validator) that you run locally — all the “scanning” happens on your side, then you paste the results back.

So all the “I can see” moments are really me reading the logs or directory listings you give me, not me reaching into your machine. Everything still runs in your environment, under your control.
