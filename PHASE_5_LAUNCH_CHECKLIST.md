3. **Pricing Page**: "Get Plus $9.99" ‚Üí Stripe
4. **Thank You**: "Start Recording" ‚Üí `/hologram-studio`

### Pricing Psychology
- Free: Creates urgency (watermark)
- Plus ($9.99): Impulse buy threshold
- Pro ($29.99): Anchors value
- Founders-100: FOMO trigger

### Conversion Path
```
Land ‚Üí Try Free (10s) ‚Üí See watermark ‚Üí Want removal ‚Üí Buy Plus ‚Üí Record 60s ‚Üí Share ‚Üí Viral
```

## Crisis Management

### If Something Breaks

#### Recording not working:
```javascript
// Emergency fix in console
localStorage.setItem('iris.plan', 'plus');
location.reload();
```

#### Stripe failing:
- Switch to manual PayPal/Venmo
- DM for payment
- Honor later with manual upgrade

#### Site down:
- Post videos directly
- Link to Google Form for signups
- "Site hugged to death! DM for early access"

### If No Sales:
1. **Hour 3**: Add "50% off TODAY" banner
2. **Hour 6**: Launch with Plus at $4.99
3. **Day 2**: Free Plus for first 10 users

### If Too Many Sales:
1. Close Founders-100 early
2. Raise prices immediately
3. Add "Waitlist" for stability
