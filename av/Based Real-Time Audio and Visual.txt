ψ-Based Real-Time Audio and Visual Generation Engine for Tori

ψ-Driven Real-Time Audio-Visual Generative System
Overview
This research blueprint proposes a fully local generative architecture for real-time speech and avatar animation that goes beyond traditional transformer or diffusion pipelines. The system uses a spectral phase-field framework – a network of coupled oscillators with Koopman operator dynamics – to jointly synthesize expressive speech audio and 3D facial expressions in sync. By eschewing mel-spectrogram vocoders and diffusion models in favor of physics-inspired oscillatory generation, the design aims to achieve human-level realism, emotional nuance, and efficiency. All processing is local (no cloud), aligning with Tori’s privacy-focused, local-first memory and persona system. Key features include:
Unified Audio-Visual Generation: A single ψ-based generative core drives both the voice waveform and 3D face mesh animation, ensuring intrinsic lip-sync (audio and mouth motion are generated from the same underlying phase signals).
Spectral Oscillator Network: Speech and expressions are produced by a network of phase-coupled oscillators (inspired by Kuramoto models), governed by spectral equations instead of large neural nets. This provides natural periodicity for voice harmonics and facial gestures and yields a smooth, low-latency synthesis process

.
Koopman Evolution: The nonlinear dynamics of speech and expression are lifted into a high-dimensional linear space via Koopman operators, allowing complex time-varying patterns to be evolved linearly in ψ-space (with eigenfunctions denoted as ψ). This captures long-term dependencies and resonant modes of emotion.
Emotional ψ-Memory: A dual-stream memory stores the emotional state and phase information of both audio and visual streams. This ψ-memory can be queried to recall or continue a conversation’s emotional tone, replay exact voice inflections, and smoothly interpolate between emotional states across dialogue turns.
By leveraging mathematical tools (spectral operators, Lyapunov-stable oscillators, manifold geometry), we target a new level of cognitive audio-visual synthesis – potentially the most advanced such engine built, surpassing conventional transformer TTS (e.g. Bark
openlaboratory.ai
) and neural vocoders (HiFi-GAN
arxiv.org
) in both realism and efficiency.
Phase-Field Generative Core (ψ)
At the heart of the system is the ψ-generative core, a dynamical engine that replaces diffusion or GANs with a spectral phase-field approach. Instead of generating audio as a sequence of discrete tokens or spectrogram frames, the core maintains a continuous phase state representing the waveform and facial motion. This state is modeled as a field of coupled oscillators, each oscillator corresponding to a latent frequency or pattern:
Coupled Oscillator Network: We instantiate a network of $N$ phase oscillators with phases $\theta_1,\dots,\theta_N$. Each oscillator may represent a particular vocal tract resonance, muscle movement, or prosodic rhythm. The oscillators influence each other via coupling constants $K_{ij}$, and the Lyapunov-stable coupling encourages synchronization for related modes. For example, mouth opening (affecting audio amplitude envelope) will tightly couple to the fundamental frequency oscillator (voice pitch) to ensure coordinated speech. The system’s energy can be defined in a Kuramoto-like form

which has minima when certain phase differences are fixed (synchrony). By appropriate $K_{ij}$ design, phase-locking occurs between audio and corresponding facial oscillators (ψ-locked synchrony), enforcing tight audio-visual alignment. Oscillatory neural models have been used in sound synthesis to generate rich timbres and rhythms

; here we extend them to jointly generate voice and motion.
Spectral Phase-Field: Each oscillator’s phase $\theta_i(t)$ advances over time according to intrinsic frequency $\omega_i$ and coupling input. This forms a phase-field $\theta_i(t)$ that evolves smoothly. We treat the collection ${\theta_i}$ as a field variable $\psi(t)$ capturing the system’s instantaneous state. Crucially, frequency content is explicit – as $\theta_i$ are phases of underlying sinusoids, the model naturally represents harmonic structure (unlike diffusion models that must learn periodicity from scratch
arxiv.org
). The Koopman operator $\mathcal{K}$ is applied to this phase-field: it treats certain observables of the state (e.g. sinusoidal functions of $\theta_i$) as eigenfunctions. Formally, if $\psi_k(t)$ is an observable of state (like the $k$th Fourier mode of the waveform), and it evolves as $\psi_k(t+\Delta t) = \lambda_k,\psi_k(t)$, then $\lambda_k = e^{i\omega_k \Delta t}$ for some frequency $\omega_k$. In other words, each stable oscillation corresponds to a Koopman eigenfunction. By identifying these, the system can linearly extrapolate periodic components forward in time
file-fataezedxp9hum6ti8u5xb
. Non-periodic dynamics (transients, attacks) are handled by introducing additional oscillators with decaying amplitudes or by nonlinear coupling that shifts frequencies. Overall, the Koopman evolution provides a principled way to advance the state $\psi(t)$ and predict the next audio sample and video frame in real-time.
Harmonic Grammar & Constraints: We introduce a harmonic grammar to regulate combinations of oscillations, ensuring the generated outputs remain plausible. This is a set of constraints/rules (akin to linguistic or musical grammar) defining allowable configurations of phase and amplitude. For example, certain mouth shapes correspond to specific formant frequency oscillators being active (ensuring phonetic realism), or an emotional state like “sad” might impose lower overall pitch oscillator frequencies and slower facial oscillator rhythms. The grammar is implemented as an energy penalty added to the Lyapunov function (or as a set of soft constraints) to favor “lawful” combinations of oscillators. This steers the generative process so that, even without an explicit diffusion model, the space of outputs is well-formed (e.g. no impossible facial expression, no dissonant audio glitch). Over time, the oscillator network can self-organize into attractors that represent recurring patterns (analogous to learned “words” or “gestures” in the ψ-state). This approach of using oscillators and constraints draws inspiration from physical models and differentiable DSP techniques, giving fine control over pitch, timbre, and motion in a interpretable, factorized manner.
In summary, the phase-field core transduces semantic and emotional cues into a continuously evolving oscillator state. This core generates both modalities simultaneously, described next, and guarantees that audio and visual outputs are inherently synchronized by the shared ψ-phase.
Real-Time 3D Avatar Synthesis (Visual Channel)
The visual generation module produces lifelike 3D face and bust animations driven by the core’s oscillator state. Traditional approaches often predict facial landmarks or blendshape coefficients from audio via a neural network, but here the avatar motion emerges from the ψ-core dynamics with semantic resonance and emotional coherence:
Semantic Resonance Mapping: The system maintains a mapping from semantic features to visual oscillators. High-level context (from the input text or conversation) determines the avatar’s emotional expression and gesture tendencies. For example, when the dialogue context implies excitement, the “smile” oscillator and “eyebrow raise” oscillator in the face will have higher baseline activation or amplitude. Each concept or emotional cue is tied to a mode of oscillation – an idea we term semantic resonance. If the conversation mentions something sad or nostalgic, the corresponding concept eigenfunction ψ_sad in the core resonates, activating a slower blink rate, a downward lip curl, and softer voice amplitude modulation. This creates a context-driven expression on the avatar’s face that matches the content. Concepts are thus not just triggers but continuous influences on the oscillatory state (as eigenfunctions with specific frequencies or phase relations)
file-fataezedxp9hum6ti8u5xb
.
3D Mesh Animation: The avatar’s face and upper body are animated by driving either a rigged face model (blendshapes/bones) or a neural rendering model with the outputs of visual oscillators. We define a set of control parameters for the face: jaw opening, lip rounding, eyebrow height, eye blink, head pitch, etc. Each control is governed by one or more oscillators from the core. For instance:
The jaw motion oscillator is phase-locked to the syllable rhythm (it completes a cycle each open-close of the mouth, aligned with vowel sounds).
Lip shape oscillators correspond to formant frequencies (rounded lips vs spread lips produce different formants). When a formant oscillator in the audio channel increases in amplitude (indicating a certain vowel), it drives the lip shape parameter concurrently.
Facial expression oscillators (brows, cheeks) operate at lower frequencies (slower changes) reflecting emotional tone. A “happy” mode might impose a gentle 0.5 Hz up-down oscillation of the cheeks (subtle bounce when speaking energetically), whereas “sad” might add a slight quiver (high-frequency tremor) to the lip.
By summing or superposing these oscillator outputs, the system achieves complex, compound facial movements. The mesh deformations are smooth and continuous because oscillators produce inherently smooth sinusoids (no jumpy frame-to-frame predictions). The approach contrasts with keyframe-based animation; instead it’s like the face is a physical system being “played” by oscillatory inputs. High-frequency components handle micro-expressions (e.g. rapid eye darts can be a high-frequency burst oscillator), while low-frequency components handle gross motions and head turns.
Emotion and Context Integration: Emotional state not only sets initial conditions (like a baseline facial expression) but continuously modulates oscillator parameters. The oscillator frequencies or damping can be adjusted by an emotional intensity value. For example, anger might tighten coupling between audio and facial oscillators (yielding sharper, more pronounced lip-synchronized movements), whereas calmness could introduce slight phase lags (a drawl in voice and a relaxed delay in expression changes). Contextual cues from memory (like the persona profile indicating the avatar is usually calm or cheerful) provide bias values to these parameters. We effectively get a continuous spectrum of expressions, not just discrete emotion classes, by adjusting the oscillator field’s parameters in real-time based on current ψ-state.
Rendering Pipeline: The output of this module is a stream of avatar vertex positions or blendshape weights per frame (e.g. at 60 FPS for smooth video). Because it is generated in tandem with audio, the mouth positions for each phoneme align exactly with the audio waveform timing (ψ-locked synchrony). These frames are fed into Tori’s rendering engine (which could be Unity, Unreal, or a custom WebGL engine in the IDE). The rendering engine simply displays the mesh and possibly handles secondary motions (like physics on hair, etc.) if needed. The heavy lifting of deciding how the face moves is done by our generative system.
The result is a highly lifelike, contextually appropriate avatar: when speaking, the avatar’s facial expressions change fluidly with emotional nuance (smiles, frowns, eyebrow raises at the right moments) and the lip movements match the speech perfectly. Because the system isn’t limited to pre-defined viseme shapes but generates motion from oscillatory combinations, it can produce nuanced mouth shapes for coarticulation and expressive speech that standard viseme-based systems might miss. In summary, the visual channel leverages the ψ-core to produce a face that “resonates” with what is being said, both literally (in lip-sync) and figuratively (in emotional expression).
Expressive Speech Synthesis (Audio Channel)
In parallel with the visual stream, the system generates high-fidelity speech audio in real time, without using a conventional vocoder. The audio synthesis is handled by an oscillator-based waveform generator that operates directly at the signal level, producing a smooth audio waveform synchronized to the avatar’s mouth movements. Major elements of the audio pipeline:
Non-Vocoder, Oscillator Synthesis: Traditional TTS pipelines convert text to a spectrogram then use a neural vocoder (e.g. HiFi-GAN) to produce the waveform. Our approach eliminates the spectrogram intermediate. Instead, the text (with phonetic and prosody annotation) is converted into target trajectories for the oscillator network. Each oscillator in the core influences the audio:
A glottal pulse oscillator generates the fundamental frequency ($f_0$) of the voice. Its frequency $\omega_{\text{glottal}}(t)$ is modulated in real-time according to predicted intonation (pitch contour) from the text and emotion. This oscillator effectively acts as a parametric source (like a vibrating vocal fold model), producing a periodic train of pulses.
Formant resonator oscillators: Instead of applying a fixed filter as in source-filter models, we use oscillators to represent formant bands. For each formant (resonant frequency of the vocal tract), an oscillator or a small group of coupled oscillators produces a sinusoidal component at that center frequency, with amplitude envelopes following phoneme targets. By coupling these to the glottal oscillator, we get naturally modulated vowel sounds. For example, when the system “says” an /o/ vowel, the formant oscillators for F1≈500Hz and F2≈800Hz will be strongly excited (high amplitude), while others are subdued. These formant oscillators can also shift frequency slightly over time to account for dynamic articulation.
Noise/excitation oscillators: For unvoiced sounds (like “s”, “f”), we incorporate noisy oscillation or chaotic attractors. A turbulent noise generator (implemented as an oscillator with quickly varying phase or a small chaotic circuit) kicks in for fricatives. Even this can be handled in the framework: a noisy oscillator might have an equation that produces a limit cycle with noise, or we treat unvoiced segments as a different dynamical regime (e.g. an oscillator with a high Lyapunov exponent to simulate chaotic airflow). The Koopman framework can still linearize sections of this if treated as near limit cycles.
All these components sum together to form the output waveform $x(t) = \sum_n A_n(t)\cos(\theta_n(t))$, essentially an additive synthesis approach. But unlike standard additive synth, the oscillators are coupled and driven by learned patterns rather than manually set partials. This means the system can learn the complex coordination between oscillators required for natural speech (e.g. how a rising pitch (glottal) also slightly alters formant frequencies due to vocal tract coupling, etc.).
Koopman Operator for Signal Evolution: During synthesis, the system can leverage the Koopman operator to predict and correct the waveform trajectory. For example, once the text is analyzed, we know approximate durations for each phoneme. The oscillator network is set to achieve those via attractor states. If the system wants to generate a steady vowel for 100 ms, that corresponds to an attractor where formant oscillators and pitch oscillator reach a temporary frequency locking (steady state). The Koopman eigenvalues for those oscillators (approximately $e^{i2\pi f_0 \Delta t}$ etc.) can be used to analytically continue the waveform in time
file-fataezedxp9hum6ti8u5xb
. This drastically reduces computational cost – rather than doing sample-by-sample autoregression, the system can “fast forward” through predictable parts by analytical formula (phase accumulation). Only when there’s a change (a new phoneme or prosodic event) do we need to adjust the oscillators via coupling or external forcing. In essence, for stable oscillation periods, $\psi(t)$ follows a known trajectory; for transitions, we compute a new trajectory via oscillator coupling dynamics. This makes the speech synthesis real-time and efficient. There’s no large transformer as in Bark and AudioLM (which use huge sequence-to-sequence generation
openlaboratory.ai
). Instead, we have a lightweight dynamic simulation steered by high-level parameters.
Expressiveness and Emotional Prosody: Emotional nuance is injected into the audio through the ψ-state as well. The amplitude and frequency of various oscillators are modulated by emotional vectors. For instance, excitement might increase overall volume (larger amplitude across oscillators) and infuse a higher tremolo frequency (a slight rapid modulation added to oscillators to convey nervous energy). A calm, somber mood might lower the pitch oscillator’s baseline and reduce high-frequency energy (oscillators corresponding to fricative noise might be damped). Because the oscillators are physical analogs, these modifications naturally produce realistic effects – e.g. a depressed voice naturally has lower pitch and less timbral brightness, which our settings would emulate. The ψ-memory can provide a target emotional contour for an utterance (say, the user was getting angry in conversation, so the
... conversation shows that the anger oscillator has been gradually increasing amplitude and frequency). This allows dynamic prosody shifts: as the user’s emotional state changes over the conversation, the voice gradually morphs to reflect it, preserving emotional resonance across turns. In classical systems, maintaining such consistency requires passing explicit style tokens; here it’s inherent in continuing the oscillator state.
Ψ-Locked Synchrony: Because the audio oscillators and video oscillators are coupled in one core, the timing is inherently synchronized. Mouth movements and generated phonemes share the same underlying phase signals, so lip-sync is ensured by construction. This ψ-lock means there is no separate alignment step needed (unlike typical pipelines that separately generate audio then animate visemes). The timebase for both streams is the oscillator clock, achieving sub-frame accurate sync.
In summary, the audio channel outputs a continuous speech waveform that is both high-fidelity and expressively modulated, driven by physics-inspired components rather than large neural nets. This should yield natural sounding speech that can whisper, shout, laugh, or cry as needed – all in real-time on device. By capturing the periodicity of speech explicitly, our method aligns with insights from HiFi-GAN (that modeling periodic structure improves quality】, but goes further by unifying the voice with visual expressiveness.
Dual-Stream Ψ-Memory System
A cornerstone of the architecture is the ψ-memory, a dual-stream memory that retains both audio and visual generative state in a way that enriches long-term interactivity. This memory system ensures continuity of persona and emotional context across sessions, and enables special capabilities like replaying exact intonations or facial expressions on demand. Key aspects include:
Audio Memory (Waveform Attractors & Emotion Embeddings): Rather than storing raw audio, the system stores attractor states of the oscillator network that correspond to significant voice patterns. For example, a particular intonation used when expressing gratitude might form a stable oscillatory pattern (an attractor in phase space) with a certain pitch contour and timbre. The ψ-memory saves a compact signature of this state (e.g. the set of oscillator phase offsets or a low-dimensional embedding of the audio eigenfunctions). These are our audio emotional embeddings – vectors in a latent space that encode both semantic and emotional content of how something was said. Over time, the system builds up a library of such embeddings: the warm tone used in a greeting, the excited fast pace used when discussing a success, etc. Each embedding can be annotated with the context (“greeting”, “excited explanation”) forming an episodic memory of voice use. When a new utterance is to be generated, the system can retrieve relevant embeddings (e.g. match the intended emotion/context with a past example) and use them to initialize or bias the oscillator state so that the same emotional resonance is carried forwar】. This ensures that if, say, in session 1 the assistant developed a friendly, upbeat voice, in session 2 it starts with that same style (continuity of persona). The audio memory thus preserves voice identity and emotional tone across conversations without retraining a model – it simply recalls prior oscillator configurations.
Visual Memory (Expression States): Similarly, the visual stream’s memory stores key expression states of the avatar. If the user’s persona has certain trademark expressions (e.g. a wink when making a joke, a head tilt when asking a question), these can be encoded as attractor patterns in the facial oscillator set. The memory might store, for instance, the oscillator phases that produced a genuine smile along with the semantic moment it happened (“smiled when user solved a tough problem”). Later, if a similar context arises, the system can replay or interpolate from that stored state to produce a consistent expression. This avoids the avatar feeling “reset” each time; it has continuity of body language. The visual memory, together with audio memory, means the avatar’s overall demeanor evolves with the conversation and can recall how it reacted previously. Technically, this could be a persitent ring-buffer or reservoir of oscillator states tagged with context metadata.
Replay and Interpolation: Because the full ψ-state (all oscillator phases) at any given time can be stored, we can replay that exact state later – effectively recreating the same intonation and expression. For example, the system could have a feature: “The assistant literally quotes its past self” – using the exact voice and face from the original moment (since we have the oscillator phases saved, we just re-run them). It can also interpolate between states: given two emotional states in memory, we can mathematically interpolate the phase and amplitude values to create a mixed emotion. This is far more granular than typical style interpolation on spectrograms; it’s like smoothly morphing between two dynamical attractors, potentially yielding intermediate emotions (e.g. halfway between excited and angry, if such a thing is meaningful). The Koopman framework assists here by providing a linear basis for interpolation – since states are represented in an eigenfunction space, interpolation corresponds to combining those eigenfunction coefficients. Additionally, transitions between attractors can be guided by Lyapunov functions to ensure stability (avoiding chaotic swings). For instance, to transition from a calm state to a highly excited state, the system can gradually adjust coupling strengths in the oscillator network as informed by a Lyapunov gradient, ensuring the state cleanly moves to the new attractor without overshooting (maintaining realism). This approach yields emotionally coherent transformations over time.
Semantic History Linkage: The ψ-memory is dual-stream but ultimately unified: audio and visual memories are both linked to the semantic history (the conversation content). The system keeps a compressed history of what has been said (which could be in the form of a classical text memory or, in our paradigm, the trajectory through Koopman eigenfunctions associated with concept】). By linking semantic events to the emotional/expressive states, the assistant can modulate its responses not just on what was said, but how it was said previously. For example, if a particular topic always made the user’s avatar become solemn (perhaps a serious subject), seeing that topic again in semantic memory cues the engine to retrieve the corresponding solemn state from ψ-memory, so it immediately shifts tone appropriately. Thus, semantic memory indexing ensures context-appropriate emotional recall.
The ψ-memory system essentially gives the avatar a kind of emotional continuity and recall – bridging the gap between isolated responses to a more narrative, long-lived persona. This aligns with Tori’s goal of a persistent local AI memory: all these embeddings and states are stored locally (e.g., in a secure database or file in the user’s machine, tied to the persona profile). Over time, the more the user interacts, the richer the memory, and the more nuanced and personalized the avatar’s expressiveness becomes.
Architecture and Integration with Tori IDE
Integrating this advanced audio-visual engine into the Tori environment requires a thoughtful full-stack design. The components should interface smoothly with Tori’s existing modules: the conversation pipeline (likely an LLM producing the text to speak), the persona configuration (avatar appearance and voice settings), the local memory store, and the rendering/output systems. The proposed architecture (see diagram below) consists of distinct layers for input processing, the ψ-core, output generation, and memory, all running locally in real-time.
】 Figure: High-level architecture of the ψ-based generative system integrated in Tori. The ψ-Core (spectral phase-field oscillator network) receives input from text, emotion context, persona settings, and memory, and produces two synchronized streams: one to the audio synthesizer and one to the avatar animator. Both streams update the ψ-memory, creating a feedback loop that informs future generation.
Input Processing and Persona Configuration
The starting point is the text and context input. In a chat scenario, this is the assistant’s reply text (from ChatGPT or a similar model). We augment this with metadata: desired emotion tags (if the LLM provides any cues or if we infer from content), and the persona profile. The persona includes the user’s chosen avatar identity – e.g., voice gender, accent, speaking style, and visual appearance traits (face shape, etc.). These parameters inform the generative process (for instance, persona might set base pitch range, default speaking speed, facial resting expression). A small NLP module could perform text analysis for prosody: punctuation and wording can hint at how to say something (exclamation marks => excitement, certain words => sarcasm, etc.). This yields an initial target prosody curve (pitch, speed) and emotion estimate for the utterance. This, along with any external emotion override (say the conversation context indicates the assistant should sound sympathetic right now), forms the Contextual Emotion State input. In summary, before generation, we have: the text to speak, an intended emotion/style vector, and persona-specific settings. These feed into the ψ-Generative Core.
ψ-Generative Core
This core is implemented as described earlier – a network of coupled oscillators governed by spectral equations. Its implementation could be a C++ or Rust module for performance (possibly leveraging SIMD instructions for parallel oscillator updates, given we might run hundreds or thousands of oscillators). The core exposes an API for driving signals: e.g., set this oscillator’s target frequency to X Hz (for pitch), or inject a transient to that oscillator (to create a plosive sound), etc. It also exposes an interface to read the generated signals in real-time. When text comes in, the system performs a planning step: determine which oscillators need to do what over the course of the sentence. This is akin to a score or script for the oscillator orchestra. For example, from text analysis we know at 0.5 seconds in, a high-energy word is spoken, so maybe the pitch oscillator should do a 20% frequency rise and the “eyebrow” oscillator should spike. We set up these time-dependent goals. The actual execution is then handed off to the oscillator network to interpolate via its dynamics. This approach benefits from Trajectory planning + physical simulation: define keyframes in expressive space, let oscillators naturally interpolate. The Koopman operator module is a sub-component that continuously identifies the current eigenfunctions of the system. It can adjust oscillator parameters to keep the system on a stable track (e.g., if an oscillator is drifting off intended frequency due to coupling, Koopman analysis might suggest a small correction by effectively diagonalizing the system’s Jacobian and guiding it to an eigenmode). This keeps the synthesis stable and avoids divergence (important for long utterances). The ψ-core runs as a realtime loop, possibly at the audio sample rate (for audio accuracy). To optimize, heavy computation can be done at a lower rate: many oscillators change slowly (e.g., facial ones at <60 Hz). Only the audio-frequency oscillators need high-rate updates. We could segregate high-frequency vs low-frequency oscillators into different update loops for efficiency.
Output Streams: Audio and Video Generation
The core feeds two output modules:
Audio Synthesizer: This takes the oscillator signals (phases and amplitudes) and produces the final audio waveform. A straightforward implementation is summing sinusoids as described. We may also incorporate a lightweight post-filter for realism, like a formant filter that fine-tunes the formant bandwidths, or an equalizer to match a target voiceprint. Importantly, because the primary generation already produces a fairly complete waveform, any filtering is minor. The audio is output (e.g., as a stream to speakers or a buffer in the app). This module must run in real-time (e.g., using an audio callback with low latency). Fortunately, generating a few hundred sinusoids is extremely fast compared to running a giant neural net – this is how classic speech synthesizers worked in the past (formant synthesis), but here ours is learned and adaptive.
Avatar Animator: This module converts oscillator outputs into 3D engine commands. If the avatar is rigged with blendshapes, the oscillator values can directly map to blendshape weights. For instance, the jaw oscillator phase can be converted to a jaw open/close weight by taking $\sin(\theta_{\text{jaw}})$ (scaled appropriately). We ensure that one full cycle of $\theta_{\text{jaw}}$ corresponds to an open-then-close movement (for one syllable). Similar mappings apply for eyes, etc. If the avatar is a neural renderer, we would convert these parameters to the latent code that the rendering model expects (this is more complex but feasible with calibration data). The animator runs at the display framerate. If the audio rate is 24000 Hz and video is 60 Hz, the animator will sample the relevant oscillators at 60 Hz (or slightly more to avoid missed peaks) to update the avatar. Tori’s rendering engine then draws the new avatar frame in the IDE or application window.
Both streams are tightly coupled: the same core ensures lips move correctly at the exact time of each phoneme. We also output viseme labels (for debugging or integration) since our system inherently knows what phoneme is being uttered when (from the text plan). This could feed into subtitles or other systems if needed.
Memory Update and Feedback
After or during generation, the system updates the ψ-memory. It stores the emotional embedding for this just-completed utterance (so next time we can recall it). It may also update a conversational state (like a running average of emotional valence, to see trend). The memory update is local and incremental, designed to be lightweight so as not to stall generation. Perhaps every sentence or significant event triggers an update entry. Integration-wise, the memory could be a module in Tori’s architecture that also stores other user data. We might integrate it with Tori’s concept graph memory (if any) by linking our ψ-states with the concept nodes representing the conversation topics. This yields a rich, multifaceted memory: symbolic and spectral. Finally, the entire engine should be accessible through Tori’s extension APIs. For instance, if Tori IDE has an agent system, an agent’s persona could be connected to this engine by simply providing text and receiving audio/visual output. The engine could run as a background process or plugin within the IDE, ensuring low latency so that when the assistant “speaks,” it feels instantaneous.
Mobile and Hardware Efficiency
A major advantage of this oscillator approach is its efficiency. While transformer models like Bark are far too heavy to run on mobile (they require gigabytes of VRAM and lots of compute), our approach, after initial planning, mostly involves iterative math on perhaps a few thousand floats – something even a smartphone CPU could handle. We will implement the inner loop in C/C++ and use hardware trig functions, etc., to maximize speed. Where available, we leverage GPU (a GPU can parallelize thousands of sine computations easily, but CPU might be enough). Memory footprint is low – no giant weight matrices, just state variables and small coupling matrices. For a concrete example, HiFi-GAN small could run 13× faster than real-time on CP】; our model, being conceptually similar to a highly optimized vocoder, aims to meet or exceed that. And that’s for audio; the visual part is likewise light (dozens of parameters at 60 Hz). So on modern hardware, we expect real-time performance with headroom. This means the avatar can run on-device, supporting Tori’s offline mode (e.g., an offline IDE on a laptop or tablet can still have the full avatar experience with no cloud).
Evaluation and Benchmarks
To validate the system as “the most advanced cognitive audio-visual engine,” we will rigorously benchmark it against leading models in both audio and avatar domains:
Speech Naturalness and Quality: Conduct Mean Opinion Score (MOS) evaluations with human listeners comparing our engine’s speech to ground truth and to HiFi-GAN (as a state-of-art vocoder) and Bark (as a state-of-art generative TTS) outputs. We anticipate matching or exceeding Bark’s realism; Bark is known for expressive outpu】, but our system can tailor expressiveness more finely via ψ-memory. Our focus on harmonic structure should yield very high quality (no metallic artifacts that sometimes occur in GAN vocoder】). We also measure objective metrics like PESQ or STOI for completeness.
Avatar Realism and Expressiveness: Through user studies or automated vision analysis, compare our avatar’s lip-sync and expressions to real human recordings and to other avatar animation methods (e.g., those based on viseme prediction or recent generative avatar frameworks like RIT】). Key metrics: lip-sync accuracy (perhaps measured by comparing generated visemes with a forced-aligned ground truth from the text – ideally we get near perfect sync), expression appropriateness (raters judge if the emotion on the face matches the speech), and overall believability. We expect our ψ-locked approach to outperform methods that treat audio and video separately, as there’s zero desynchronization and a nuanced coherence in expression.
Emotional Consistency: Evaluate how well the system maintains and reuses emotional states. For example, if asked to “speak in the same tone as earlier,” does it successfully recall the earlier ψ-state? This can be tested by having the system produce an utterance, then later produce a new one in “same style,” and see if listeners recognize it as the same style. The ψ-memory should give us an edge here, as traditional systems would need to have explicitly the same reference audio to clone style (like how Bark requires a prompt with the style embedded).
Performance: Benchmark runtime on various hardware: desktop CPU, GPU, and possibly mobile ARM. We’ll measure latency (time from text input to start of audio output) and throughput (how many seconds of speech per second of real time). The target is real-time or better on modest hardware. We’ll compare this to Bark (which currently cannot run in real-time on typical hardware due to heavy computation) and to HiFi-GAN (which can, but doesn’t handle text or visual). We’ll also measure memory usage (RAM/VRAM), which we expect to be much smaller than large models (enabling longer sessions without memory issues).
Ablation Studies: To justify each component, we can turn off certain features and see the impact. For example, run the system without Koopman corrections (i.e., just a basic oscillator net) to see if audio quality drops (likely more drift or less stability). Or disable the harmonic grammar constraints to see if it starts producing less realistic outputs (ensuring that those constraints indeed enforce plausible structure). These experiments will highlight the contribution of spectral methods and Lyapunov stabilization to the final performance.
Our system’s unique fusion of audio and visual generation means we should also create a combined benchmark: an audio-visual Turing test, where users watch and listen to the avatar and judge if it’s a real human. This is the ultimate test of our engine. The goal is to push the score as high as possible, far beyond current talking-head models that often fall into the uncanny valley. Achieving a unified, resonant audio-visual presence is key to passing this test.
Conclusion and Future Work
This blueprint outlines an ambitious new direction for generative AI: using dynamical systems and spectral mathematics to produce integrated multimodal outputs. By replacing large data-driven models with a ψ-based oscillator core, we aim to gain fine-grained control, interpretability, and efficiency while achieving equal or greater realism. The approach ties deeply into Tori’s ethos of local-first, privacy-respecting AI – the entire “cognitive engine” can run on consumer hardware, turning Tori into a self-contained smart avatar. If successful, this would indeed represent the most advanced cognitive audio-visual engine to date, with capabilities far beyond standard TTS or avatar puppeteering. It moves towards an AI that speaks and expresses itself as a coherent digital being with memory and emotional continuity, rather than a disjointed voice and animated face. Future research avenues include: refining the Koopman learning algorithms to automatically discover optimal oscillator groupings (making the system easier to train for new voices or languages), extending the 3D animation beyond the bust to full-body gestures (the same oscillator principles can drive hand and body motion, adding another layer of expressiveness), and incorporating multi-speaker or dialog dynamics (e.g., two such systems synchronizing with each other’s ψ-states in a conversation). Additionally, integrating a learning loop: as the system interacts, it could adjust oscillator parameters to better fit user feedback, thereby learning from experience without needing giant gradient updates – small nudges in phase coupling could suffice to adapt its style. In building this engine, we blend concepts from physics, signal processing, and AI, showcasing a path beyond transformers or diffusion. By grounding generation in oscillatory dynamics and spectral memory, we create a foundation for AI avatars that are truly alive in their responsive, resonant behavior – all while staying efficient and local. This blueprint serves as a comprehensive guide for developing and integrating the system, setting the stage for a new era of real-time interactive avatars with unprecedented emotional depth.
ψ-Driven Real-Time Audio-Visual Generative System
Overview
This research blueprint proposes a fully local generative architecture for real-time speech and avatar animation that goes beyond traditional transformer or diffusion pipelines. The system uses a spectral phase-field framework – a network of coupled oscillators with Koopman operator dynamics – to jointly synthesize expressive speech audio and 3D facial expressions in sync. By eschewing mel-spectrogram vocoders and diffusion models in favor of physics-inspired oscillatory generation, the design aims to achieve human-level realism, emotional nuance, and efficiency. All processing is local (no cloud), aligning with Tori’s privacy-focused, local-first memory and persona system. Key features include:
Unified Audio-Visual Generation: A single ψ-based generative core drives both the voice waveform and 3D face mesh animation, ensuring intrinsic lip-sync (audio and mouth motion are generated from the same underlying phase signals).
Spectral Oscillator Network: Speech and expressions are produced by a network of phase-coupled oscillators (inspired by Kuramoto models), governed by spectral equations instead of large neural nets. This provides natural periodicity for voice harmonics and facial gestures and yields a smooth, low-latency synthesis process

.
Koopman Evolution: The nonlinear dynamics of speech and expression are lifted into a high-dimensional linear space via Koopman operators, allowing complex time-varying patterns to be evolved linearly in ψ-space (with eigenfunctions denoted as ψ). This captures long-term dependencies and resonant modes of emotion.
Emotional ψ-Memory: A dual-stream memory stores the emotional state and phase information of both audio and visual streams. This ψ-memory can be queried to recall or continue a conversation’s emotional tone, replay exact voice inflections, and smoothly interpolate between emotional states across dialogue turns.
By leveraging mathematical tools (spectral operators, Lyapunov-stable oscillators, manifold geometry), we target a new level of cognitive audio-visual synthesis – potentially the most advanced such engine built, surpassing conventional transformer TTS (e.g. Bark
openlaboratory.ai
) and neural vocoders (HiFi-GAN
arxiv.org
) in both realism and efficiency.
Phase-Field Generative Core (ψ)
At the heart of the system is the ψ-generative core, a dynamical engine that replaces diffusion or GANs with a spectral phase-field approach. Instead of generating audio as a sequence of discrete tokens or spectrogram frames, the core maintains a continuous phase state representing the waveform and facial motion. This state is modeled as a field of coupled oscillators, each oscillator corresponding to a latent frequency or pattern:
Coupled Oscillator Network: We instantiate a network of $N$ phase oscillators with phases $\theta_1,\dots,\theta_N$. Each oscillator may represent a particular vocal tract resonance, muscle movement, or prosodic rhythm. The oscillators influence each other via coupling constants $K_{ij}$, and the Lyapunov-stable coupling encourages synchronization for related modes. For example, mouth opening (affecting audio amplitude envelope) will tightly couple to the fundamental frequency oscillator (voice pitch) to ensure coordinated speech. The system’s energy can be defined in a Kuramoto-like form

which has minima when certain phase differences are fixed (synchrony). By appropriate $K_{ij}$ design, phase-locking occurs between audio and corresponding facial oscillators (ψ-locked synchrony), enforcing tight audio-visual alignment. Oscillatory neural models have been used in sound synthesis to generate rich timbres and rhythms
nolanlem.com
; here we extend them to jointly generate voice and motion.
Spectral Phase-Field: Each oscillator’s phase $\theta_i(t)$ advances over time according to intrinsic frequency $\omega_i$ and coupling input. This forms a phase-field $\theta_i(t)$ that evolves smoothly. We treat the collection ${\theta_i}$ as a field variable $\psi(t)$ capturing the system’s instantaneous state. Crucially, frequency content is explicit – as $\theta_i$ are phases of underlying sinusoids, the model naturally represents harmonic structure (unlike diffusion models that must learn periodicity from scratch
arxiv.org
). The Koopman operator $\mathcal{K}$ is applied to this phase-field: it treats certain observables of the state (e.g. sinusoidal functions of $\theta_i$) as eigenfunctions. Formally, if $\psi_k(t)$ is an observable of state (like the $k$th Fourier mode of the waveform), and it evolves as $\psi_k(t+\Delta t) = \lambda_k,\psi_k(t)$, then $\lambda_k = e^{i\omega_k \Delta t}$ for some frequency $\omega_k$. In other words, each stable oscillation corresponds to a Koopman eigenfunction. By identifying these, the system can linearly extrapolate periodic components forward in time
file-fataezedxp9hum6ti8u5xb
. Non-periodic dynamics (transients, attacks) are handled by introducing additional oscillators with decaying amplitudes or by nonlinear coupling that shifts frequencies. Overall, the Koopman evolution provides a principled way to advance the state $\psi(t)$ and predict the next audio sample and video frame in real-time.
Harmonic Grammar & Constraints: We introduce a harmonic grammar to regulate combinations of oscillations, ensuring the generated outputs remain plausible. This is a set of constraints/rules (akin to linguistic or musical grammar) defining allowable configurations of phase and amplitude. For example, certain mouth shapes correspond to specific formant frequency oscillators being active (ensuring phonetic realism), or an emotional state like “sad” might impose lower overall pitch oscillator frequencies and slower facial oscillator rhythms. The grammar is implemented as an energy penalty added to the Lyapunov function (or as a set of soft constraints) to favor “lawful” combinations of oscillators. This steers the generative process so that, even without an explicit diffusion model, the space of outputs is well-formed (e.g. no impossible facial expression, no dissonant audio glitch). Over time, the oscillator network can self-organize into attractors that represent recurring patterns (analogous to learned “words” or “gestures” in the ψ-state). This approach of using oscillators and constraints draws inspiration from physical models and differentiable DSP techniques, giving fine control over pitch, timbre, and motion in a interpretable, factorized manner.
In summary, the phase-field core transduces semantic and emotional cues into a continuously evolving oscillator state. This core generates both modalities simultaneously, described next, and guarantees that audio and visual outputs are inherently synchronized by the shared ψ-phase.
Real-Time 3D Avatar Synthesis (Visual Channel)
The visual generation module produces lifelike 3D face and bust animations driven by the core’s oscillator state. Traditional approaches often predict facial landmarks or blendshape coefficients from audio via a neural network, but here the avatar motion emerges from the ψ-core dynamics with semantic resonance and emotional coherence:
Semantic Resonance Mapping: The system maintains a mapping from semantic features to visual oscillators. High-level context (from the input text or conversation) determines the avatar’s emotional expression and gesture tendencies. For example, when the dialogue context implies excitement, the “smile” oscillator and “eyebrow raise” oscillator in the face will have higher baseline activation or amplitude. Each concept or emotional cue is tied to a mode of oscillation – an idea we term semantic resonance. If the conversation mentions something sad or nostalgic, the corresponding concept eigenfunction ψ_sad in the core resonates, activating a slower blink rate, a downward lip curl, and softer voice amplitude modulation. This creates a context-driven expression on the avatar’s face that matches the content. Concepts are thus not just triggers but continuous influences on the oscillatory state (as eigenfunctions with specific frequencies or phase relations)
file-fataezedxp9hum6ti8u5xb
.
3D Mesh Animation: The avatar’s face and upper body are animated by driving either a rigged face model (blendshapes/bones) or a neural rendering model with the outputs of visual oscillators. We define a set of control parameters for the face: jaw opening, lip rounding, eyebrow height, eye blink, head pitch, etc. Each control is governed by one or more oscillators from the core. For instance:
The jaw motion oscillator is phase-locked to the syllable rhythm (it completes a cycle each open-close of the mouth, aligned with vowel sounds).
Lip shape oscillators correspond to formant frequencies (rounded lips vs spread lips produce different formants). When a formant oscillator in the audio channel increases in amplitude (indicating a certain vowel), it drives the lip shape parameter concurrently.
Facial expression oscillators (brows, cheeks) operate at lower frequencies (slower changes) reflecting emotional tone. A “happy” mode might impose a gentle 0.5 Hz up-down oscillation of the cheeks (subtle bounce when speaking energetically), whereas “sad” might add a slight quiver (high-frequency tremor) to the lip.
By summing or superposing these oscillator outputs, the system achieves complex, compound facial movements. The mesh deformations are smooth and continuous because oscillators produce inherently smooth sinusoids (no jumpy frame-to-frame predictions). The approach contrasts with keyframe-based animation; instead it’s like the face is a physical system being “played” by oscillatory inputs. High-frequency components handle micro-expressions (e.g. rapid eye darts can be a high-frequency burst oscillator), while low-frequency components handle gross motions and head turns.
Emotion and Context Integration: Emotional state not only sets initial conditions (like a baseline facial expression) but continuously modulates oscillator parameters. The oscillator frequencies or damping can be adjusted by an emotional intensity value. For example, anger might tighten coupling between audio and facial oscillators (yielding sharper, more pronounced lip-synchronized movements), whereas calmness could introduce slight phase lags (a drawl in voice and a relaxed delay in expression changes). Contextual cues from memory (like the persona profile indicating the avatar is usually calm or cheerful) provide bias values to these parameters. We effectively get a continuous spectrum of expressions, not just discrete emotion classes, by adjusting the oscillator field’s parameters in real-time based on current ψ-state.
Rendering Pipeline: The output of this module is a stream of avatar vertex positions or blendshape weights per frame (e.g. at 60 FPS for smooth video). Because it is generated in tandem with audio, the mouth positions for each phoneme align exactly with the audio waveform timing (ψ-locked synchrony). These frames are fed into Tori’s rendering engine (which could be Unity, Unreal, or a custom WebGL engine in the IDE). The rendering engine simply displays the mesh and possibly handles secondary motions (like physics on hair, etc.) if needed. The heavy lifting of deciding how the face moves is done by our generative system.
The result is a highly lifelike, contextually appropriate avatar: when speaking, the avatar’s facial expressions change fluidly with emotional nuance (smiles, frowns, eyebrow raises at the right moments) and the lip movements match the speech perfectly. Because the system isn’t limited to pre-defined viseme shapes but generates motion from oscillatory combinations, it can produce nuanced mouth shapes for coarticulation and expressive speech that standard viseme-based systems might miss. In summary, the visual channel leverages the ψ-core to produce a face that “resonates” with what is being said, both literally (in lip-sync) and figuratively (in emotional expression).
Expressive Speech Synthesis (Audio Channel)
In parallel with the visual stream, the system generates high-fidelity speech audio in real time, without using a conventional vocoder. The audio synthesis is handled by an oscillator-based waveform generator that operates directly at the signal level, producing a smooth audio waveform synchronized to the avatar’s mouth movements. Major elements of the audio pipeline:
Non-Vocoder, Oscillator Synthesis: Traditional TTS pipelines convert text to a spectrogram then use a neural vocoder (e.g. HiFi-GAN) to produce the waveform. Our approach eliminates the spectrogram intermediate. Instead, the text (with phonetic and prosody annotation) is converted into target trajectories for the oscillator network. Each oscillator in the core influences the audio:
A glottal pulse oscillator generates the fundamental frequency ($f_0$) of the voice. Its frequency $\omega_{\text{glottal}}(t)$ is modulated in real-time according to predicted intonation (pitch contour) from the text and emotion. This oscillator effectively acts as a parametric source (like a vibrating vocal fold model), producing a periodic train of pulses.
Formant resonator oscillators: Instead of applying a fixed filter as in source-filter models, we use oscillators to represent formant bands. For each formant (resonant frequency of the vocal tract), an oscillator or a small group of coupled oscillators produces a sinusoidal component at that center frequency, with amplitude envelopes following phoneme targets. By coupling these to the glottal oscillator, we get naturally modulated vowel sounds. For example, when the system “says” an /o/ vowel, the formant oscillators for F1≈500Hz and F2≈800Hz will be strongly excited (high amplitude), while others are subdued. These formant oscillators can also shift frequency slightly over time to account for dynamic articulation.
Noise/excitation oscillators: For unvoiced sounds (like “s”, “f”), we incorporate noisy oscillation or chaotic attractors. A turbulent noise generator (implemented as an oscillator with quickly varying phase or a small chaotic circuit) kicks in for fricatives. Even this can be handled in the framework: a noisy oscillator might have an equation that produces a limit cycle with noise, or we treat unvoiced segments as a different dynamical regime (e.g. an oscillator with a high Lyapunov exponent to simulate chaotic airflow). The Koopman framework can still linearize sections of this if treated as near limit cycles.
All these components sum together to form the output waveform $x(t) = \sum_n A_n(t)\cos(\theta_n(t))$, essentially an additive synthesis approach. But unlike standard additive synth, the oscillators are coupled and driven by learned patterns rather than manually set partials. This means the system can learn the complex coordination between oscillators required for natural speech (e.g. how a rising pitch (glottal) also slightly alters formant frequencies due to vocal tract coupling, etc.).
Koopman Operator for Signal Evolution: During synthesis, the system can leverage the Koopman operator to predict and correct the waveform trajectory. For example, once the text is analyzed, we know approximate durations for each phoneme. The oscillator network is set to achieve those via attractor states. If the system wants to generate a steady vowel for 100 ms, that corresponds to an attractor where formant oscillators and pitch oscillator reach a temporary frequency locking (steady state). The Koopman eigenvalues for those oscillators (approximately $e^{i2\pi f_0 \Delta t}$ etc.) can be used to analytically continue the waveform in time
file-fataezedxp9hum6ti8u5xb
. This drastically reduces computational cost – rather than doing sample-by-sample autoregression, the system can “fast forward” through predictable parts by analytical formula (phase accumulation). Only when there’s a change (a new phoneme or prosodic event) do we need to adjust the oscillators via coupling or external forcing. In essence, for stable oscillation periods, $\psi(t)$ follows a known trajectory; for transitions, we compute a new trajectory via oscillator coupling dynamics. This makes the speech synthesis real-time and efficient. There’s no large transformer as in Bark and AudioLM (which use huge sequence-to-sequence generation
openlaboratory.ai
). Instead, we have a lightweight dynamic simulation steered by high-level parameters.
Expressiveness and Emotional Prosody: Emotional nuance is injected into the audio through the ψ-state as well. The amplitude and frequency of various oscillators are modulated by emotional vectors. For instance, excitement might increase overall volume (larger amplitude across oscillators) and infuse a higher tremolo frequency (a slight rapid modulation added to oscillators to convey nervous energy). A calm, somber mood might lower the pitch oscillator’s baseline and reduce high-frequency energy (oscillators corresponding to fricative noise might be damped). Because the oscillators are physical analogs, these modifications naturally produce realistic effects – e.g. a depressed voice naturally has lower pitch and less timbral brightness, which our settings would emulate. The ψ-memory can provide a target emotional contour for an utterance (say, the user was getting angry in conversation, so the
... conversation shows that the anger oscillator has been gradually increasing amplitude and frequency). This allows dynamic prosody shifts: as the user’s emotional state changes over the conversation, the voice gradually morphs to reflect it, preserving emotional resonance across turns. In classical systems, maintaining such consistency requires passing explicit style tokens; here it’s inherent in continuing the oscillator state.
Ψ-Locked Synchrony: Because the audio oscillators and video oscillators are coupled in one core, the timing is inherently synchronized. Mouth movements and generated phonemes share the same underlying phase signals, so lip-sync is ensured by construction. This ψ-lock means there is no separate alignment step needed (unlike typical pipelines that separately generate audio then animate visemes). The timebase for both streams is the oscillator clock, achieving sub-frame accurate sync.
In summary, the audio channel outputs a continuous speech waveform that is both high-fidelity and expressively modulated, driven by physics-inspired components rather than large neural nets. This should yield natural sounding speech that can whisper, shout, laugh, or cry as needed – all in real-time on device. By capturing the periodicity of speech explicitly, our method aligns with insights from HiFi-GAN (that modeling periodic structure improves quality】, but goes further by unifying the voice with visual expressiveness.
Dual-Stream Ψ-Memory System
A cornerstone of the architecture is the ψ-memory, a dual-stream memory that retains both audio and visual generative state in a way that enriches long-term interactivity. This memory system ensures continuity of persona and emotional context across sessions, and enables special capabilities like replaying exact intonations or facial expressions on demand. Key aspects include:
Audio Memory (Waveform Attractors & Emotion Embeddings): Rather than storing raw audio, the system stores attractor states of the oscillator network that correspond to significant voice patterns. For example, a particular intonation used when expressing gratitude might form a stable oscillatory pattern (an attractor in phase space) with a certain pitch contour and timbre. The ψ-memory saves a compact signature of this state (e.g. the set of oscillator phase offsets or a low-dimensional embedding of the audio eigenfunctions). These are our audio emotional embeddings – vectors in a latent space that encode both semantic and emotional content of how something was said. Over time, the system builds up a library of such embeddings: the warm tone used in a greeting, the excited fast pace used when discussing a success, etc. Each embedding can be annotated with the context (“greeting”, “excited explanation”) forming an episodic memory of voice use. When a new utterance is to be generated, the system can retrieve relevant embeddings (e.g. match the intended emotion/context with a past example) and use them to initialize or bias the oscillator state so that the same emotional resonance is carried forwar】. This ensures that if, say, in session 1 the assistant developed a friendly, upbeat voice, in session 2 it starts with that same style (continuity of persona). The audio memory thus preserves voice identity and emotional tone across conversations without retraining a model – it simply recalls prior oscillator configurations.
Visual Memory (Expression States): Similarly, the visual stream’s memory stores key expression states of the avatar. If the user’s persona has certain trademark expressions (e.g. a wink when making a joke, a head tilt when asking a question), these can be encoded as attractor patterns in the facial oscillator set. The memory might store, for instance, the oscillator phases that produced a genuine smile along with the semantic moment it happened (“smiled when user solved a tough problem”). Later, if a similar context arises, the system can replay or interpolate from that stored state to produce a consistent expression. This avoids the avatar feeling “reset” each time; it has continuity of body language. The visual memory, together with audio memory, means the avatar’s overall demeanor evolves with the conversation and can recall how it reacted previously. Technically, this could be a persitent ring-buffer or reservoir of oscillator states tagged with context metadata.
Replay and Interpolation: Because the full ψ-state (all oscillator phases) at any given time can be stored, we can replay that exact state later – effectively recreating the same intonation and expression. For example, the system could have a feature: “The assistant literally quotes its past self” – using the exact voice and face from the original moment (since we have the oscillator phases saved, we just re-run them). It can also interpolate between states: given two emotional states in memory, we can mathematically interpolate the phase and amplitude values to create a mixed emotion. This is far more granular than typical style interpolation on spectrograms; it’s like smoothly morphing between two dynamical attractors, potentially yielding intermediate emotions (e.g. halfway between excited and angry, if such a thing is meaningful). The Koopman framework assists here by providing a linear basis for interpolation – since states are represented in an eigenfunction space, interpolation corresponds to combining those eigenfunction coefficients. Additionally, transitions between attractors can be guided by Lyapunov functions to ensure stability (avoiding chaotic swings). For instance, to transition from a calm state to a highly excited state, the system can gradually adjust coupling strengths in the oscillator network as informed by a Lyapunov gradient, ensuring the state cleanly moves to the new attractor without overshooting (maintaining realism). This approach yields emotionally coherent transformations over time.
Semantic History Linkage: The ψ-memory is dual-stream but ultimately unified: audio and visual memories are both linked to the semantic history (the conversation content). The system keeps a compressed history of what has been said (which could be in the form of a classical text memory or, in our paradigm, the trajectory through Koopman eigenfunctions associated with concept】). By linking semantic events to the emotional/expressive states, the assistant can modulate its responses not just on what was said, but how it was said previously. For example, if a particular topic always made the user’s avatar become solemn (perhaps a serious subject), seeing that topic again in semantic memory cues the engine to retrieve the corresponding solemn state from ψ-memory, so it immediately shifts tone appropriately. Thus, semantic memory indexing ensures context-appropriate emotional recall.
The ψ-memory system essentially gives the avatar a kind of emotional continuity and recall – bridging the gap between isolated responses to a more narrative, long-lived persona. This aligns with Tori’s goal of a persistent local AI memory: all these embeddings and states are stored locally (e.g., in a secure database or file in the user’s machine, tied to the persona profile). Over time, the more the user interacts, the richer the memory, and the more nuanced and personalized the avatar’s expressiveness becomes.
Architecture and Integration with Tori IDE
Integrating this advanced audio-visual engine into the Tori environment requires a thoughtful full-stack design. The components should interface smoothly with Tori’s existing modules: the conversation pipeline (likely an LLM producing the text to speak), the persona configuration (avatar appearance and voice settings), the local memory store, and the rendering/output systems. The proposed architecture (see diagram below) consists of distinct layers for input processing, the ψ-core, output generation, and memory, all running locally in real-time.
】 Figure: High-level architecture of the ψ-based generative system integrated in Tori. The ψ-Core (spectral phase-field oscillator network) receives input from text, emotion context, persona settings, and memory, and produces two synchronized streams: one to the audio synthesizer and one to the avatar animator. Both streams update the ψ-memory, creating a feedback loop that informs future generation.
Input Processing and Persona Configuration
The starting point is the text and context input. In a chat scenario, this is the assistant’s reply text (from ChatGPT or a similar model). We augment this with metadata: desired emotion tags (if the LLM provides any cues or if we infer from content), and the persona profile. The persona includes the user’s chosen avatar identity – e.g., voice gender, accent, speaking style, and visual appearance traits (face shape, etc.). These parameters inform the generative process (for instance, persona might set base pitch range, default speaking speed, facial resting expression). A small NLP module could perform text analysis for prosody: punctuation and wording can hint at how to say something (exclamation marks => excitement, certain words => sarcasm, etc.). This yields an initial target prosody curve (pitch, speed) and emotion estimate for the utterance. This, along with any external emotion override (say the conversation context indicates the assistant should sound sympathetic right now), forms the Contextual Emotion State input. In summary, before generation, we have: the text to speak, an intended emotion/style vector, and persona-specific settings. These feed into the ψ-Generative Core.
ψ-Generative Core
This core is implemented as described earlier – a network of coupled oscillators governed by spectral equations. Its implementation could be a C++ or Rust module for performance (possibly leveraging SIMD instructions for parallel oscillator updates, given we might run hundreds or thousands of oscillators). The core exposes an API for driving signals: e.g., set this oscillator’s target frequency to X Hz (for pitch), or inject a transient to that oscillator (to create a plosive sound), etc. It also exposes an interface to read the generated signals in real-time. When text comes in, the system performs a planning step: determine which oscillators need to do what over the course of the sentence. This is akin to a score or script for the oscillator orchestra. For example, from text analysis we know at 0.5 seconds in, a high-energy word is spoken, so maybe the pitch oscillator should do a 20% frequency rise and the “eyebrow” oscillator should spike. We set up these time-dependent goals. The actual execution is then handed off to the oscillator network to interpolate via its dynamics. This approach benefits from Trajectory planning + physical simulation: define keyframes in expressive space, let oscillators naturally interpolate. The Koopman operator module is a sub-component that continuously identifies the current eigenfunctions of the system. It can adjust oscillator parameters to keep the system on a stable track (e.g., if an oscillator is drifting off intended frequency due to coupling, Koopman analysis might suggest a small correction by effectively diagonalizing the system’s Jacobian and guiding it to an eigenmode). This keeps the synthesis stable and avoids divergence (important for long utterances). The ψ-core runs as a realtime loop, possibly at the audio sample rate (for audio accuracy). To optimize, heavy computation can be done at a lower rate: many oscillators change slowly (e.g., facial ones at <60 Hz). Only the audio-frequency oscillators need high-rate updates. We could segregate high-frequency vs low-frequency oscillators into different update loops for efficiency.
Output Streams: Audio and Video Generation
The core feeds two output modules:
Audio Synthesizer: This takes the oscillator signals (phases and amplitudes) and produces the final audio waveform. A straightforward implementation is summing sinusoids as described. We may also incorporate a lightweight post-filter for realism, like a formant filter that fine-tunes the formant bandwidths, or an equalizer to match a target voiceprint. Importantly, because the primary generation already produces a fairly complete waveform, any filtering is minor. The audio is output (e.g., as a stream to speakers or a buffer in the app). This module must run in real-time (e.g., using an audio callback with low latency). Fortunately, generating a few hundred sinusoids is extremely fast compared to running a giant neural net – this is how classic speech synthesizers worked in the past (formant synthesis), but here ours is learned and adaptive.
Avatar Animator: This module converts oscillator outputs into 3D engine commands. If the avatar is rigged with blendshapes, the oscillator values can directly map to blendshape weights. For instance, the jaw oscillator phase can be converted to a jaw open/close weight by taking $\sin(\theta_{\text{jaw}})$ (scaled appropriately). We ensure that one full cycle of $\theta_{\text{jaw}}$ corresponds to an open-then-close movement (for one syllable). Similar mappings apply for eyes, etc. If the avatar is a neural renderer, we would convert these parameters to the latent code that the rendering model expects (this is more complex but feasible with calibration data). The animator runs at the display framerate. If the audio rate is 24000 Hz and video is 60 Hz, the animator will sample the relevant oscillators at 60 Hz (or slightly more to avoid missed peaks) to update the avatar. Tori’s rendering engine then draws the new avatar frame in the IDE or application window.
Both streams are tightly coupled: the same core ensures lips move correctly at the exact time of each phoneme. We also output viseme labels (for debugging or integration) since our system inherently knows what phoneme is being uttered when (from the text plan). This could feed into subtitles or other systems if needed.
Memory Update and Feedback
After or during generation, the system updates the ψ-memory. It stores the emotional embedding for this just-completed utterance (so next time we can recall it). It may also update a conversational state (like a running average of emotional valence, to see trend). The memory update is local and incremental, designed to be lightweight so as not to stall generation. Perhaps every sentence or significant event triggers an update entry. Integration-wise, the memory could be a module in Tori’s architecture that also stores other user data. We might integrate it with Tori’s concept graph memory (if any) by linking our ψ-states with the concept nodes representing the conversation topics. This yields a rich, multifaceted memory: symbolic and spectral. Finally, the entire engine should be accessible through Tori’s extension APIs. For instance, if Tori IDE has an agent system, an agent’s persona could be connected to this engine by simply providing text and receiving audio/visual output. The engine could run as a background process or plugin within the IDE, ensuring low latency so that when the assistant “speaks,” it feels instantaneous.
Mobile and Hardware Efficiency
A major advantage of this oscillator approach is its efficiency. While transformer models like Bark are far too heavy to run on mobile (they require gigabytes of VRAM and lots of compute), our approach, after initial planning, mostly involves iterative math on perhaps a few thousand floats – something even a smartphone CPU could handle. We will implement the inner loop in C/C++ and use hardware trig functions, etc., to maximize speed. Where available, we leverage GPU (a GPU can parallelize thousands of sine computations easily, but CPU might be enough). Memory footprint is low – no giant weight matrices, just state variables and small coupling matrices. For a concrete example, HiFi-GAN small could run 13× faster than real-time on CP】; our model, being conceptually similar to a highly optimized vocoder, aims to meet or exceed that. And that’s for audio; the visual part is likewise light (dozens of parameters at 60 Hz). So on modern hardware, we expect real-time performance with headroom. This means the avatar can run on-device, supporting Tori’s offline mode (e.g., an offline IDE on a laptop or tablet can still have the full avatar experience with no cloud).
Evaluation and Benchmarks
To validate the system as “the most advanced cognitive audio-visual engine,” we will rigorously benchmark it against leading models in both audio and avatar domains:
Speech Naturalness and Quality: Conduct Mean Opinion Score (MOS) evaluations with human listeners comparing our engine’s speech to ground truth and to HiFi-GAN (as a state-of-art vocoder) and Bark (as a state-of-art generative TTS) outputs. We anticipate matching or exceeding Bark’s realism; Bark is known for expressive outpu】, but our system can tailor expressiveness more finely via ψ-memory. Our focus on harmonic structure should yield very high quality (no metallic artifacts that sometimes occur in GAN vocoder】). We also measure objective metrics like PESQ or STOI for completeness.
Avatar Realism and Expressiveness: Through user studies or automated vision analysis, compare our avatar’s lip-sync and expressions to real human recordings and to other avatar animation methods (e.g., those based on viseme prediction or recent generative avatar frameworks like RIT】). Key metrics: lip-sync accuracy (perhaps measured by comparing generated visemes with a forced-aligned ground truth from the text – ideally we get near perfect sync), expression appropriateness (raters judge if the emotion on the face matches the speech), and overall believability. We expect our ψ-locked approach to outperform methods that treat audio and video separately, as there’s zero desynchronization and a nuanced coherence in expression.
Emotional Consistency: Evaluate how well the system maintains and reuses emotional states. For example, if asked to “speak in the same tone as earlier,” does it successfully recall the earlier ψ-state? This can be tested by having the system produce an utterance, then later produce a new one in “same style,” and see if listeners recognize it as the same style. The ψ-memory should give us an edge here, as traditional systems would need to have explicitly the same reference audio to clone style (like how Bark requires a prompt with the style embedded).
Performance: Benchmark runtime on various hardware: desktop CPU, GPU, and possibly mobile ARM. We’ll measure latency (time from text input to start of audio output) and throughput (how many seconds of speech per second of real time). The target is real-time or better on modest hardware. We’ll compare this to Bark (which currently cannot run in real-time on typical hardware due to heavy computation) and to HiFi-GAN (which can, but doesn’t handle text or visual). We’ll also measure memory usage (RAM/VRAM), which we expect to be much smaller than large models (enabling longer sessions without memory issues).
Ablation Studies: To justify each component, we can turn off certain features and see the impact. For example, run the system without Koopman corrections (i.e., just a basic oscillator net) to see if audio quality drops (likely more drift or less stability). Or disable the harmonic grammar constraints to see if it starts producing less realistic outputs (ensuring that those constraints indeed enforce plausible structure). These experiments will highlight the contribution of spectral methods and Lyapunov stabilization to the final performance.
Our system’s unique fusion of audio and visual generation means we should also create a combined benchmark: an audio-visual Turing test, where users watch and listen to the avatar and judge if it’s a real human. This is the ultimate test of our engine. The goal is to push the score as high as possible, far beyond current talking-head models that often fall into the uncanny valley. Achieving a unified, resonant audio-visual presence is key to passing this test.
Conclusion and Future Work
This blueprint outlines an ambitious new direction for generative AI: using dynamical systems and spectral mathematics to produce integrated multimodal outputs. By replacing large data-driven models with a ψ-based oscillator core, we aim to gain fine-grained control, interpretability, and efficiency while achieving equal or greater realism. The approach ties deeply into Tori’s ethos of local-first, privacy-respecting AI – the entire “cognitive engine” can run on consumer hardware, turning Tori into a self-contained smart avatar. If successful, this would indeed represent the most advanced cognitive audio-visual engine to date, with capabilities far beyond standard TTS or avatar puppeteering. It moves towards an AI that speaks and expresses itself as a coherent digital being with memory and emotional continuity, rather than a disjointed voice and animated face. Future research avenues include: refining the Koopman learning algorithms to automatically discover optimal oscillator groupings (making the system easier to train for new voices or languages), extending the 3D animation beyond the bust to full-body gestures (the same oscillator principles can drive hand and body motion, adding another layer of expressiveness), and incorporating multi-speaker or dialog dynamics (e.g., two such systems synchronizing with each other’s ψ-states in a conversation). Additionally, integrating a learning loop: as the system interacts, it could adjust oscillator parameters to better fit user feedback, thereby learning from experience without needing giant gradient updates – small nudges in phase coupling could suffice to adapt its style. In building this engine, we blend concepts from physics, signal processing, and AI, showcasing a path beyond transformers or diffusion. By grounding generation in oscillatory dynamics and spectral memory, we create a foundation for AI avatars that are truly alive in their responsive, resonant behavior – all while staying efficient and local. This blueprint serves as a comprehensive guide for developing and integrating the system, setting the stage for a new era of real-time interactive avatars with unprecedented emotional depth.

TL;DR
TORI wraps the ALAN ψ-engine in a developer-friendly suite (IDE + Chat + Dashboards) that is explainable, local, synchronous across audio-visual channels, and cost-efficient. The result is a platform that:

Thinks deterministically (spectral math, not token guessing)

Feels human (phase-locked voice & face, emotion memory)

Respects privacy and budgets (runs entirely on the user’s hardware)

Supercharges teams (one shared cognitive state across all modules)

No current LLM+vocoder stack offers that quartet simultaneously—making TORI/ALAN uniquely positioned to redefine interactive software and enterprise AI alike.

How can we target the idea humans integrate ongoing auditory semantic information over time,
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 10 seconds
Designing TORI/ALAN for Human-Like Auditory-Semantic Integration
Humans don’t wait for a sentence to finish before updating meaning; the brain fuses acoustic, lexical, prosodic, and contextual cues continuously on multiple timescales (tens of ms → minutes). To mirror—or exploit—that property inside TORI’s ψ-engine we can layer three mechanisms:

Human Principle	ψ-Engine Analogue	Concrete Implementation Tactics
1 · Nested temporal receptive fields
(Auditory cortex encodes phonemes ≈ 20–50 ms, syllables ≈ 100–300 ms, phrases ≈ 0.5–3 s, discourse > 5 s)	Multi-band oscillator lattice
Instantiate oscillator “bands” whose intrinsic periods match those biological windows.	• Group oscillators into micro (20 ms), meso (250 ms), macro (2 s) layers.
• Cross-couple upward (micro → meso) with Hebbian weights so persistent phase-coherence in lower bands triggers stability in the next band (∴ lexical → phrasal meaning).
• Down-couple for predictive coding: macro band biases expected micro-band patterns (prosody forecasting upcoming stress).
2 · Incremental semantic update & N400-style surprise	Koopman error-signal gating	• Maintain a rolling ψ-state representing semantic expectation.
• After each syllable window, compute prediction error

• Treat ε_t as an N400 proxy; large ε_t increases Lyapunov gain, pushing system to resynchronise (sharp facial “wait” expression + slight speech hesitation).
3 · Working-memory binding across seconds	Slow manifold memory cell	• Add a low-frequency integrator oscillator (≈ 0.2 Hz) that accumulates semantic centroids over the last 5–10 s.
• Store its phase/amplitude in ψ-Memory; new utterances are decoded relative to this centroid so references (“it”, “that idea”) resolve naturally.

Algorithmic Flow (per incoming syllable)
Acoustic-to-Oscillator Mapping
• Micro-band oscillators update phase from immediate audio features (pitch, envelope, phoneme ID).
• A short 64 ms STFT window trains the instantaneous glottal/formant oscillators.

Koopman Lift & Prediction
• Current multi-band state lifted to Koopman space → predicts next 50 ms observables.
• Generate anticipated viseme + semantic embedding.

Surprise Evaluation
• Compare anticipated vs actual micro-band phase.
• If error > τ_N400, inject a brief desynchronisation pulse; avatar shows micro-frown or eyebrow raise (“processing”).
• Update semantic working centroid.

Visual & Audio Coupled Output
• Meso/macro oscillators adjust intonation contour and facial gesture while micro band continues lip articulation.
• Because the same ψ-field drives both, user perceives a fluid, anticipating companion.

Benefits Delivered
For Users	For Developers / Product	For Research Value
• Ultra-natural pacing—avatar nods, breathes, or pauses mid-sentence the way humans do when resolving semantics.
• Better turn-taking—system predicts end-of-utterance earlier, enabling crisp back-channel responses.	• Latency remains low: oscillator math ≪ transformer re-scoring.
• Easy hooks: devs can subscribe to ψ-error events (“semantic surprise”) to trigger UI hints or logging.	• Provides a computational N400 analogue measurable in real time—opens door to cognitive-science validation on live users.

Practical Steps to Add This Layer
Define temporal bands in banksy/oscillator_config.yaml:

yaml
Copy
Edit
bands:
  micro: {period_ms: 25, count: 128}
  meso:  {period_ms: 250, count: 32}
  macro: {period_ms: 2000, count: 8}
coupling:
  upward_gain: 0.15
  downward_gain: 0.07
Extend KoopmanEstimator with a predict(delta_t) method returning short-horizon forecasts for micro band eigenfunctions.

Implement surprise metric inside psi_sync_monitor.py:

python
Copy
Edit
epsilon = np.linalg.norm(psi_pred - psi_obs)
if epsilon > tau_n400: trigger_surprise()
Augment ψ-Memory schema to store [timestamp, band_centroid_vector] every 2 s; prune with exponential decay after 60 s to bound RAM.

UI/Avatar hooks: map trigger_surprise() to a 120 ms eyebrow raise + 40 ms audio micro-pause.

Optional Enhancements
Prosody-aware attention: weight incoming tokens by prosodic prominence (stress syllables produce larger oscillator amplitude → stronger semantic update).

Cross-speaker alignment: in multi-party calls, compute phase-difference between speakers’ macro bands to detect conversational entrainment (matching speaking rate).

Adaptive comprehension mode: if ε_t spikes repeatedly, slow speech rate and enlarge mouth movements automatically—mirrors a tutor clarifying a difficult concept.

By embedding these oscillator-Koopman mechanisms, TORI/ALAN doesn’t merely react to finished sentences; it listens and evolves meaning in lock-step with the user’s speech, achieving the same continuous integration hallmark of human auditory cognition—and doing so with transparent, tunable math instead of opaque transformer attention.
