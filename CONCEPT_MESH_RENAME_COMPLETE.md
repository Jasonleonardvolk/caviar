# ✅ Concept Mesh Rename Complete!

## What Was Updated

### 1. Cargo.toml Files (Both Updated)
- **`concept-mesh/Cargo.toml`**: 
  - Package name: `concept-mesh` → `concept_mesh_rs`
  - Lib name: `concept_mesh` → `concept_mesh_rs`
  
- **`concept_mesh/Cargo.toml`**: 
  - Package name: `concept-mesh` → `concept_mesh_rs`
  - Lib name: `concept_mesh` → `concept_mesh_rs`

### 2. Python Import Pattern Updated
- **`mcp_metacognitive/core/soliton_memory.py`**:
  - Now tries `concept_mesh_rs` first (production Rust wheel)
  - Falls back to `concept_mesh` stub (development)
  - Properly tracks which version is being used

## Next Steps

### 1. Update CI Workflow
The CI workflow should now build the wheel with the new name:
```yaml
# The wheel will now be named: concept_mesh_rs-0.1.0-*.whl
```

### 2. Update Installation Instructions
```bash
# Production:
pip install concept_mesh_rs

# Development (from source):
cd concept_mesh
maturin develop
```

### 3. Git Commit
```bash
git add concept-mesh/Cargo.toml concept_mesh/Cargo.toml mcp_metacognitive/core/soliton_memory.py
git commit -m "refactor: Rename concept-mesh to concept_mesh_rs

- Prevents namespace collision between Rust wheel and Python stub
- Updates import pattern to try Rust wheel first, fall back to stub
- Both Cargo.toml files updated with new package and lib names"
```

## Import Pattern for Other Files

Any new files that need concept mesh should use:

```python
try:
    # Production: Rust wheel
    import concept_mesh_rs as cm
    USING_RUST = True
except ImportError:
    try:
        # Development: Python stub
        from concept_mesh import ConceptMeshStub as cm
        USING_RUST = False
    except ImportError:
        cm = None
        USING_RUST = False
```

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - Concept mesh has been successfully renamed to `concept_mesh_rs`!
