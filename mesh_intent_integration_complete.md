# TORI Mesh-Anchored Intent System - Complete Implementation ✅

## Date: 8/7/2025

## 🎯 What We've Implemented

Complete **Mesh/Knowledge Graph Integration** for semantic intent anchoring. Every intent is now grounded in the ConceptMesh, enabling:
- Semantic closure detection through graph traversal
- Context-aware intent enrichment
- Knowledge-based nudging
- Intent path suggestions between topics

## 📊 Architecture

```

## 🔧 Key Components Added

### 1. **Enhanced IntentTrace** (`intent_trace.py`)
```python
@dataclass
class IntentTrace:
    # NEW: Mesh anchoring fields
    mesh_anchor: Optional[str] = None  # Node ID in ConceptMesh
    mesh_context: Dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)  # Cached context
    mesh_path: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)  # Path to satisfaction
    mesh_coverage_score: float = 0.0  # How much context is covered
    
    def check_mesh_closure(self, mesh, coverage_threshold=0.7) -> bool:
        """Check if intent is satisfied based on mesh traversal"""
```

### 2. **ConceptMesh Intent Methods** (`concept_mesh.py`)
```python
def find_or_create_anchor(self, text: str, intent_type: str = None) -> Optional[str]:
    """Find or create an anchor node for an intent"""
    
def traverse_context(self, node_id: str, depth: int = 2) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Traverse semantic context from an anchor node"""
    
def calculate_intent_coverage(self, anchor_id: str, covered_concepts: List[str]) -> float:
    """Calculate how much of an intent's semantic context is covered"""
    
def suggest_intent_path(self, from_anchor: str, to_anchor: str) -> List[str]:
    """Suggest a path from one intent to another through the mesh"""
```

### 3. **Updated Conversation Manager** (`conversation_manager.py`)
- Initializes ConceptMesh alongside other components
- Anchors every new intent to a mesh node
- Uses mesh traversal for closure detection
- Enriches intent context from semantic neighbors

## 🚀 How It Works

### Intent Creation with Anchoring
1. User says: "How do I create a new project?"
2. System extracts concepts: ["create", "project"]
3. Finds or creates anchor node in mesh
4. Stores anchor ID in IntentTrace
5. Caches semantic context (related nodes)

### Mesh-Based Closure Detection
1. As conversation progresses, system tracks covered concepts
2. Calculates coverage score: `covered_nodes / total_context_nodes`
3. When coverage > threshold (70%), intent marked as satisfied
4. Closure trigger: `MESH_PATH_COMPLETE`

### Semantic Enrichment
```python
# When creating intent
mesh_anchor = mesh.find_or_create_anchor(description, intent_type)
mesh_context = mesh.traverse_context(mesh_anchor, depth=2)

# Context includes:
{
    "anchor": "node_123",
    "nodes": ["concept_1", "concept_2", ...],  # Related concepts
    "relations": [...],  # How they connect
    "keywords": ["project", "create", ...],  # Extracted terms
    "types": ["action", "creation", ...]  # Concept types
}
```

## 📈 Benefits

### 1. **Semantic Understanding**
- Intents are grounded in knowledge graph
- System understands related concepts
- Can detect satisfaction through semantic coverage

### 2. **Contextual Intelligence**
- Mesh provides rich context for each intent
- Related concepts inform response generation
- Can suggest related topics naturally

### 3. **Path-Based Navigation**
- Can find paths between intents
- Enables smooth topic transitions
- Supports multi-intent conversations

### 4. **Learning & Evolution**
- New concepts auto-added as anchors
- Mesh grows with conversation
- Relations strengthen over time

## 🎮 Usage Example

```python
from conversation_manager import CognitiveConversationManager

# Initialize with mesh enabled
manager = CognitiveConversationManager(
    memory_vault_dir="memory_vault",
    enable_mesh=True  # Enable ConceptMesh integration
)

# Process input - automatically anchored to mesh
response = manager.process_user_input(
    "I want to learn about machine learning"
)

# Intent is anchored to ML concept in mesh
# Related concepts (AI, neural networks, etc.) cached
# Closure detected when enough context covered

# Check mesh coverage for open intents
for trace in manager.trace_manager.get_open_traces():
    if trace.mesh_anchor:
        coverage = manager.mesh.calculate_intent_coverage(
            trace.mesh_anchor,
            trace.supporting_actions
        )
        print(f"Intent {trace.intent_type}: {coverage:.1%} mesh coverage")
```

## 📊 Mesh-Driven Metrics

New metrics available:
- **Mesh Coverage Score**: How much semantic context is addressed
- **Anchor Density**: Intents per mesh region
- **Path Complexity**: Average path length between intents
- **Context Richness**: Average context size per intent

## 🔄 The Semantic Loop

1. **Anchor**: Intent → Mesh Node
2. **Enrich**: Node → Context (neighbors, relations)
3. **Track**: Responses → Coverage calculation
4. **Close**: Coverage > threshold → Satisfaction
5. **Learn**: New nodes/relations added

## 🎯 What This Enables

### Immediate Benefits
- ✅ Every intent has semantic grounding
- ✅ Closure detection through knowledge coverage
- ✅ Rich context for response generation
- ✅ Natural topic transitions via mesh paths

### Future Possibilities
- 🔮 Intent prediction from mesh patterns
- 🔮 Proactive suggestions based on context
- 🔮 Learning user's knowledge graph
- 🔮 Cross-session intent persistence

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Semantic Anchoring**: Every intent is a node or path in knowledge space
2. **Coverage as Closure**: Satisfaction = sufficient context coverage
3. **Mesh as Memory**: The graph becomes conversational memory
4. **Emergent Understanding**: New connections form naturally

## ✅ Integration Complete

The system now provides:
- **Semantic grounding** for every intent
- **Knowledge-based closure** detection
- **Context-aware nudging** from mesh
- **Path-based transitions** between topics

The mesh acts as TORI's semantic backbone, ensuring intents are not just tracked but truly understood in the context of the knowledge graph.

**Every intent now has a home in the mesh.** 🕸️✨
