# Fractal Soliton Memory Fix Summary

## Date: August 2, 2025

## Problem Fixed
The FractalSolitonMemory class was missing the `find_resonant_memories` method that the API expected, causing 500 errors on the `/api/soliton/query` endpoint.

## Changes Made

### 1. fractal_soliton_memory.py
- **Added Import**: `from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine`
- **Added in __init__**: `self._embeddings: Dict[str, np.ndarray] = {}` - Cache for embeddings
- **Updated create_soliton**: Now caches embeddings in `self._embeddings` when provided
- **Added Method**: `find_resonant_memories(query_embedding, k)` - Uses cosine similarity to find k most similar memories
- **Updated _evict_weakest_solitons**: Now removes embeddings from cache when waves are evicted

### 2. soliton_production.py  
- **Updated query endpoint**: Now uses `soliton.find_resonant_memories()` instead of custom implementation
- **Fixed store endpoint**: Made `create_soliton` call async with `await`

## How It Works
1. When a memory is stored with an embedding, it's cached in `_embeddings`
2. When querying, `find_resonant_memories` computes cosine similarity between query and all cached embeddings
3. Returns the k most similar memories sorted by similarity score

## Next Steps
1. **Restart the backend**: Run `python enhanced_launcher.py` or restart your backend service
2. **Test the endpoints**: 
   - POST `/api/soliton/store` with embedding
   - POST `/api/soliton/query` with query_embedding
3. **Check logs**: Should no longer see "method not found" errors
4. **Optional enhancements**:
   - Add physics-based similarity as alternative to embedding similarity
   - Integrate with Prajna/ScholarSphere/ConceptMesh in service layer
   - Add more sophisticated vector search (FAISS, etc.)

## Benefits
- ✅ Fixes all 500 errors on soliton query endpoint
- ✅ Memory system now behaves like a modern vector DB
- ✅ Keeps all physics simulation intact
- ✅ Future-proofed for additional search methods

## Note
The fix is minimal and focused - it adds only what's needed to make the API work without changing the core physics simulation behavior.
