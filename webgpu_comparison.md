# WebGPU Directory Comparison: TORI vs Pigpen

## üîç Key Finding: fftCompute.ts was MODIFIED!

### File Differences:

| File | TORI (kha) | Pigpen | Difference |
|------|------------|---------|------------|
| **fftCompute.ts** | 23,711 bytes | **24,342 bytes** | **+631 bytes** added in pigpen! |
| Modified | Jun 26, 14:40 | **Jun 27, 13:18** | Pigpen modified ~23 hours later |
| fftCompute.ts.backup | ‚ùå Not present | ‚úÖ Present | Backup created during modifications |

### üéØ This is significant because:

1. **FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)** is used for signal processing and could be crucial for:
   - Concept extraction from data
   - Pattern recognition
   - Feature extraction
   - Data transformation for the mesh

2. **The backup file** suggests you made important changes and wanted to preserve the original

3. **631 bytes added** - This is likely error handling, validation, or processing logic that fixed the concept import

### Files to Check:

1. **Compare fftCompute.ts** between TORI and pigpen:
   - The pigpen version is 631 bytes larger
   - Modified on June 27 (yesterday)
   - This likely contains your import fixes!

2. **Check fftCompute.ts.backup**:
   - This is probably the original version before your fixes
   - Comparing it to the current fftCompute.ts will show exactly what you changed

### Next Steps:

```batch
# Show the differences in fftCompute.ts
fc ${IRIS_ROOT}\frontend\lib\webgpu\fftCompute.ts C:\Users\jason\Desktop\pigpen\frontend\lib\webgpu\fftCompute.ts

# Or copy the fixed version to TORI
copy C:\Users\jason\Desktop\pigpen\frontend\lib\webgpu\fftCompute.ts ${IRIS_ROOT}\frontend\lib\webgpu\fftCompute.ts
```

The FFT compute modifications are likely where you fixed the concept processing that allowed you to go from 0 ‚Üí 100 ‚Üí 1095 concepts!
