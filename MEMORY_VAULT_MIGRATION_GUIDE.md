# Memory Vault Dashboard Migration Guide

## Overview

The Memory Vault Dashboard has been successfully migrated from the React frontend (`tori_chat_frontend`) to the Svelte UI (`tori_ui_svelte`) with full integration to the soliton-vault backend API.

## What Has Been Completed

### 1. Enhanced Memory Vault Dashboard Component
- **Location**: `tori_ui_svelte/src/lib/components/vault/MemoryVaultDashboard.svelte`
- **Features**:
  - Full TypeScript support with proper type safety
  - Real-time memory statistics from Soliton backend
  - Phase-based memory tracking (amplitude, frequency, coherence)
  - Chat history viewing with concept extraction
  - PDF statistics integration
  - Export functionality for memory archives
  - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
  - Error handling and retry logic
  - Backend connection status monitoring

### 2. API Endpoints Created
All necessary API endpoints have been created in the Svelte routes:

#### Memory State Endpoint
- **Path**: `/api/memory/state`
- **File**: `tori_ui_svelte/src/routes/api/memory/state/+server.ts`
- **Purpose**: Returns current memory system state including Soliton engine status

#### Chat History Endpoint  
- **Path**: `/api/chat/history`
- **File**: `tori_ui_svelte/src/routes/api/chat/history/+server.ts`
- **Purpose**: Returns recent chat sessions with concepts and metadata

#### Export All Sessions Endpoint
- **Path**: `/api/chat/export-all`
- **File**: `tori_ui_svelte/src/routes/api/chat/export-all/+server.ts`
- **Purpose**: Exports all memory data as a zip archive

#### PDF Statistics Endpoint
- **Path**: `/api/pdf/stats`
- **File**: `tori_ui_svelte/src/routes/api/pdf/stats/+server.ts`
- **Purpose**: Returns PDF processing statistics

### 3. Integration Points

#### Soliton Memory Service
- The dashboard fully integrates with the existing `solitonMemory.ts` service
- Uses stores for reactive updates: `memoryStats`, `currentPhase`, `phaseAmplitude`, etc.
- Proper error handling when backend is unavailable

#### Concept Mesh Integration
- Connects to existing `conceptMesh` and `systemCoherence` stores
- Displays vault contents in the dedicated "Vault" tab
- Shows concept relationships and metadata

## Backend Requirements

The following backend endpoints need to be implemented in the Python/FastAPI backend:

### 1. Memory State Endpoint
```
GET /api/memory/state/{user_id}
Response: {
  "engineHealth": { "success": bool, "backend": string },
  "capabilities": { ... },
  "solitonMemory": { "totalMemories": int, ... },
  "pdfIngestion": { "totalUploads": int, ... }
}
```

### 2. Chat History Endpoint
```
GET /api/chat/history/{user_id}?limit=10&offset=0
Response: {
  "history": [
    {
      "session_id": string,
      "timestamp": ISO string,
      "persona": string,
      "message_count": int,
      "concepts": string[],
      "type": "chat" | "document"
    }
  ],
  "total": int
}
```

### 3. Export Endpoint
```
POST /api/chat/export-all
Body: { "userId": string, "format": "toripack-zip", ... }
Response: Binary ZIP file
```

### 4. PDF Stats Endpoint
```
GET /api/pdf/stats/{user_id}
Response: {
  "totalDocuments": int,
  "totalConcepts": int,
  "phaseMappings": int,
  "avgConceptsPerDoc": float,
  "recentUploads": array
}
```

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Access the Memory Vault
Navigate to `/vault` in the Svelte UI to access the enhanced Memory Vault Dashboard.

### 2. Features Available
- **Overview Tab**: System status, memory statistics, PDF integration stats
- **History Tab**: Browse recent chat sessions, search by concepts, export individual sessions
- **Vault Tab**: View all stored concepts from the concept mesh
- **Analytics Tab**: Placeholder for future analytics features

### 3. Export Functionality
- Click "Export All" to download a complete memory archive
- Individual sessions can be exported as `.toripack` files
- Exports include all concepts, metadata, and phase information

## Next Steps

### 1. Backend Implementation
The Python backend needs to implement the four API endpoints listed above to fully enable the Memory Vault Dashboard.

### 2. Analytics Features
The Analytics tab is currently a placeholder. Future features could include:
- Memory pattern visualization
- Concept relationship graphs
- Phase dynamics charts
- Cognitive growth metrics

### 3. Toripack Viewer
The Toripack Viewer modal is currently a placeholder. Implementation would allow:
- Viewing exported memory packages
- Importing/restoring from backups
- Sharing memory contexts

### 4. Real-time Updates
Consider implementing WebSocket connections for:
- Live memory updates
- Real-time phase changes
- Instant concept extraction notifications

## Testing

To test the integration:

1. Ensure the backend is running with Soliton Memory support
2. Log in to the Svelte UI
3. Navigate to `/vault`
4. Verify:
   - Memory statistics load correctly
   - Chat history displays
   - Export functionality works
   - Error states handle gracefully when backend is offline

## Migration Notes

- The original React component at `tori_chat_frontend/src/components/MemoryVaultDashboard.jsx` can be deprecated
- All functionality has been preserved and enhanced in the Svelte version
- The new implementation uses TypeScript for better type safety
- Styling has been updated to match the Svelte UI design system

## Support

For issues or questions about the Memory Vault Dashboard:
1. Check backend logs for API errors
2. Verify Soliton Memory service is initialized
3. Ensure proper user authentication
4. Check browser console for frontend errors
