# End-to-End Verification Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The end-to-end verification was failing at steps 06 (Build_and_Package) and 07 (Artifact_Verification) due to:

1. **Test 06 Issue**: npm warnings were being written to stderr, which PowerShell was treating as errors when using strict error handling
2. **Test 07 Issue**: Dependent on test 06 completing successfully, so it failed when test 06 failed

## Solution Applied
Fixed the `Verify-EndToEnd.ps1` script with the following changes:

### 1. Modified Run-Logged Function
- Changed error handling to use `ErrorActionPreference = "Continue"` within the function
- This prevents stderr output (like npm warnings) from being treated as failures
- Now relies on actual exit codes ($LASTEXITCODE) rather than PowerShell's automatic error detection

### 2. Enhanced Build_and_Package Step
- Added explicit error action preference handling for the IrisOneButton.ps1 execution
- Properly captures and returns the actual exit code from the build process

### 3. Improved Artifact Verification
- Added more descriptive error messages when artifacts are missing
- Better handling of missing directories or files

## Files Modified
- **Original backed up to**: `D:\Dev\kha\tools\release\Verify-EndToEnd.ps1.backup`
- **Fixed version at**: `D:\Dev\kha\tools\release\Verify-EndToEnd.ps1`

## How to Test
Run the fixed script:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\release\Verify-EndToEnd.ps1
```

Or with quick build option:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\release\Verify-EndToEnd.ps1 -QuickBuild
```

## Expected Results
- Tests 01-05 should continue to pass as before
- Test 06 (Build_and_Package) should now pass even with npm warnings
- Test 07 (Artifact_Verification) should pass if the build creates the expected artifacts

## Rollback Instructions
If needed, restore the original script:
```powershell
Move-Item -Force .\tools\release\Verify-EndToEnd.ps1.backup .\tools\release\Verify-EndToEnd.ps1
```

## Additional Notes
- The fix preserves all original functionality while handling warnings more gracefully
- Exit codes are now properly propagated through the script chain
- npm warnings will still be logged but won't cause test failures
