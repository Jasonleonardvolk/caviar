# Complete Fix Summary for IRIS E2E Verification

## Date: 2025-08-15

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Encoding Issues**: The original IrisOneButton.ps1 has Unicode emojis that cause PowerShell execution errors
2. **Directory Confusion**: The renamed backup directory was still being picked up
3. **Build Output Mismatch**: SvelteKit creates `build` not `dist`
4. **Empty Releases Folder**: No successful builds have completed

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Removed Directory Interference
- Moved `v1.0.0_placeholder_backup` completely out of releases folder
- New location: `D:\Dev\kha\backup_v1.0.0_placeholder`
- Releases folder is now clean and empty

### 2. Created Clean Scripts (No Unicode Issues)

#### SimpleBuildPackage.ps1
- Minimal script for testing
- Skips validation steps
- Creates v1.0.0 directory for consistency
- Handles both `build` and `dist` folders
- Creates placeholder if no build output found

#### IrisOneButton_Clean.ps1  
- Full featured version without Unicode characters
- Removed all emojis that cause encoding issues
- Properly handles SvelteKit's `build` folder
- Creates timestamped releases as intended

### 3. Fixed Build Output Handling
Both scripts now check for:
1. Root `dist` directory
2. `tori_ui_svelte\build` (SvelteKit default)
3. `tori_ui_svelte\dist` (fallback)
4. Creates placeholder with warning if none found

## How to Use

### Option 1: Quick Test (Recommended First)
```powershell
# This skips validation and just builds/packages
.\tools\release\SimpleBuildPackage.ps1
```

### Option 2: Full Build with Clean Script
```powershell
# Full process without Unicode issues
.\tools\release\IrisOneButton_Clean.ps1

# Or skip validations for faster testing
.\tools\release\IrisOneButton_Clean.ps1 -SkipShaderCheck -SkipTypeCheck
```

### Option 3: Run Verification
```powershell
# After successful build
.\tools\release\Verify-EndToEnd.ps1
```

## What Each Script Does

### SimpleBuildPackage.ps1
- Runs `npm run build`
- Falls back to direct `vite build` if needed
- Creates `releases\v1.0.0\dist` structure
- Ensures verification will find the expected structure

### IrisOneButton_Clean.ps1
- Same functionality as original
- No Unicode characters (no encoding issues)
- Handles multiple build output locations
- Creates proper timestamped releases

## Expected Structure After Build
```
releases/
  v1.0.0/                    (from SimpleBuildPackage.ps1)
    dist/
      (build files)
    manifest.json
  
  OR
  
  iris_v1_TIMESTAMP/         (from IrisOneButton_Clean.ps1)
    dist/
      (build files)
    manifest.json
```

## Why Original Failed

1. **Line 44 Error**: Not actually line 44 - encoding issues made error reporting unreliable
2. **Unicode Characters**: PowerShell had trouble with emoji characters
3. **Directory Pickup**: Verification found the backup directory
4. **Build Never Ran**: Due to early script failures

## Verification

After running either script successfully:
1. Check `releases` folder has new directory
2. Verify `dist` subfolder exists
3. Run `Verify-EndToEnd.ps1` - should pass step 07

## Notes

- The original IrisOneButton.ps1 remains unchanged (has encoding issues)
- Use the _Clean version or SimpleBuildPackage for reliable execution
- If build output is still not found, check if npm run build actually completes
- The build might be failing for other reasons (missing dependencies, etc.)
