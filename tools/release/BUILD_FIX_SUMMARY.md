# Build Script Error Fixes Summary

## Date: 2025-08-15

## Problems Identified in Your Simple Script

### 1. ❌ **Fixed Directory Name Issue**
- **Problem**: Used hardcoded `releases\v1.0.0` directory
- **Impact**: Verify-EndToEnd.ps1 would always check this same directory with stale data
- **Fixed**: Added option to use timestamped directories OR properly clean v1.0.0 each time

### 2. ❌ **No Build Output Validation**
- **Problem**: Didn't verify if files were actually created
- **Fixed**: Added file counting and reporting

### 3. ❌ **Stale Data Issue**
- **Problem**: If v1.0.0 existed, it would keep old/incomplete files
- **Fixed**: Now cleans the directory before creating new release

## Solutions Implemented

### SimpleBuildFix.ps1 (NEW)
Created a fixed version with:
- **Cleaning**: Removes existing v1.0.0 directory before creating new one
- **Validation**: Counts and reports files in dist
- **Flexibility**: `-UseTimestamp` switch to use timestamped directories
- **Better Feedback**: Shows what was found and created

### IrisOneButton.ps1 (UPDATED)
Fixed version now properly:
- Checks for SvelteKit's `build` folder
- Checks for traditional `dist` folder
- Always creates consistent `dist` subfolder in release
- Provides clear warnings when build output missing

## Key Differences Between Scripts

| Feature | Your Original | SimpleBuildFix.ps1 | IrisOneButton.ps1 |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Directory naming | Fixed v1.0.0 | v1.0.0 (cleaned) or timestamp | Always timestamp |
| Cleans old data | No | Yes | N/A (new dir) |
| Build validation | No | Yes | Yes |
| Shader checks | No | No | Yes |
| TypeScript checks | No | No | Yes |
| Complexity | Simple | Simple+ | Full featured |

## Usage

### Quick Build (Simple):
```powershell
# Uses v1.0.0 directory (cleaned each time)
.\tools\release\SimpleBuildFix.ps1

# OR with timestamp
.\tools\release\SimpleBuildFix.ps1 -UseTimestamp
```

### Full Build (Complete):
```powershell
# Full validation and timestamped release
.\tools\release\IrisOneButton.ps1

# Skip validations for speed
.\tools\release\IrisOneButton.ps1 -SkipShaderCheck -SkipTypeCheck
```

### Verify Either:
```powershell
.\tools\release\Verify-EndToEnd.ps1
```

## What Was Actually Wrong

The core issue was **directory management**:
1. Your script created `v1.0.0` without cleaning it
2. Verification found this directory with old/incomplete content
3. The "Missing dist" error occurred because old v1.0.0 had no dist folder

## Testing

Run this sequence to verify everything works:
```powershell
# Test simple build
.\tools\release\SimpleBuildFix.ps1

# Check it passes verification
.\tools\release\Verify-EndToEnd.ps1

# If that works, test full build
.\tools\release\IrisOneButton.ps1
```

Both scripts should now pass verification successfully!
