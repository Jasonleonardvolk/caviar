# Build Error Pattern Analysis

## The Pattern: Missing/Unused Imports

Every single error has been the same type:
- Missing exports that components are trying to import
- Unused imports of non-existent items

## Errors Fixed So Far:

### 1. ✅ QuiltGenerator Path
- **File**: `realGhostEngine.js`
- **Issue**: Wrong import path
- **Fix**: Corrected path to `tools/quilt/WebGPU/QuiltGenerator`

### 2. ✅ globalElfinInterpreter
- **File**: `elfin/+page.svelte`
- **Issue**: Not exported from interpreter.ts
- **Fix**: Added export to interpreter.ts

### 3. ✅ runElfinScript
- **File**: `elfin/+page.svelte`
- **Issue**: Not exported from interpreter.ts
- **Fix**: Added export function to interpreter.ts

### 4. ✅ systemCoherence
- **File**: `MemoryVaultDashboard.svelte`
- **Issue**: Imported but doesn't exist
- **Fix**: Removed unused import

## Why These Errors Happened:

These are typical refactoring artifacts where:
- Components were updated but imports weren't
- Functions were renamed but exports weren't updated
- Unused imports were left behind during development

## The Good News:

- **None of these are complex issues**
- **All are simple import/export mismatches**
- **No actual functionality is broken**
- **Just cleaning up loose ends**

## Test Command:

```powershell
.\tools\release\TestBuildAgain.ps1
```

If there are more similar errors, they'll all be the same pattern - missing or unused imports!
