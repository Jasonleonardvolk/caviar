## ðŸ”¥ **Key Technical Innovations**

### **Phase Vector Reasoning**
```python
phase_vector = [semantic_density, abstraction_level, temporal_proximity]
drift = L2_distance(phase_vector[i], phase_vector[j])
cost = phase_drift + (1 - resonance) + mode_adjustments
```

### **Cognitive Pathfinding Algorithm**
```python
# Enhanced Dijkstra for conceptual reasoning
cost(A â†’ B) = phase_drift + (1 - resonance) + mode_penalty + length_penalty
```

### **Trust Enhancement with Reasoning**
```python
if reasoning_triggered:
    trust_boost = reasoning_confidence * 0.2
    final_trust = min(1.0, base_trust + trust_boost)
```

### **Mode-Specific Cost Functions**
- **Explanatory**: Favors high resonance for clear connections
- **Causal**: Penalizes high drift for logical chains
- **Analogical**: Allows more drift for pattern matching
- **Comparative**: Balances drift and resonance equally

    "enable_reasoning": true
  }'
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/answer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_query": "What causes neural network learning?",
    "reasoning_mode": "causal",
    "enable_reasoning": true
  }'
```

ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  user_query: "Explain the connection between information theory and consciousness",
  enable_reasoning: true,
  streaming: true
}));

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  
  if (data.type === 'reasoning') {
    console.log(`Reasoning: ${data.mode} (confidence: ${data.confidence})`);
    console.log(`Narrative: ${data.narrative}`);
  } else if (data.type === 'chunk') {
    process.stdout.write(data.content);
  } else if (data.type === 'complete') {
    console.log(`\nSources: ${data.sources}`);
    console.log(`Reasoning triggered: ${data.reasoning_triggered}`);
  }

## ðŸŽª **What Makes This Revolutionary**

### **1. True Cognitive Architecture**
This isn't just retrieval + generation - it's **actual pathfinding through conceptual space** with semantic coherence preservation.

### **2. Phase-Stable Reasoning**
The phase drift minimization ensures reasoning **stays semantically coherent** rather than wandering into unrelated concepts.

### **3. Mode-Aware Intelligence**
Different types of reasoning (causal vs analogical) use **different optimization strategies** - this mirrors human cognitive flexibility.

### **4. Explainable AI**
Every reasoning step is **traceable with confidence scores**, coherence metrics, and natural language explanations.

### **5. Production Integration**
Seamlessly integrates with existing TORI systems while providing **graceful fallbacks** when reasoning is unavailable.
