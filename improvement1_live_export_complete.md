# Improvement #1: Live Mesh Context Update (Event-Driven Export)

## Date: 8/7/2025

## 🎯 What We've Built

Enhanced the mesh export system from Phase 2 with **event-driven live updates** that trigger exports immediately after high-impact events, not just nightly:

- **Event Triggers**: Intent closure, document upload, concept changes, session end, manual
- **Debouncing**: Prevents excessive exports (configurable cooldown period)
- **Hybrid Mode**: Combines event-driven and nightly exports
- **Event Logging**: Complete audit trail of all export events
- **Thread-Safe**: Singleton pattern with proper locking

## 📊 Architecture

```
High-Impact Event
        ↓
Trigger Function (e.g., trigger_intent_closed_export)
        ↓
MeshSummaryExporter.trigger_export()
        ↓
    Debounce Check
        ↓
    Export if allowed
        ↓
    Log Event
        ↓
Updated mesh_context.json
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Export Triggers

```python
class ExportTrigger(Enum):
    NIGHTLY = "nightly"              # Scheduled nightly export
    INTENT_CLOSED = "intent_closed"  # Intent resolved/closed
    DOCUMENT_UPLOAD = "document_upload"  # New document ingested
    CONCEPT_CHANGE = "concept_change"    # Major mesh change (>5 concepts)
    MANUAL = "manual"                # User-triggered
    SESSION_END = "session_end"      # High-impact session ended
```

### Export Modes

```python
class ExportMode(Enum):
    NIGHTLY = "nightly"  # Only scheduled exports
    EVENT = "event"      # Only event-driven exports
    HYBRID = "hybrid"    # Both (recommended)
```

### Configuration

```python
# In SaigonConfig
mesh_export_mode: str = "hybrid"
mesh_export_debounce_minutes: int = 10
enable_live_mesh_export: bool = True
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Trigger Export on Intent Closure

```python
from intent_trace import IntentTraceWithExport

# Initialize with live export enabled
tracer = IntentTraceWithExport(enable_live_export=True)

# Close intent - automatically triggers export
tracer.close_intent(
    user_id="alice",
    intent_id="opt_001",
    resolution="completed"
)
# Export triggered immediately!
```

### Trigger Export on Document Upload

```python
from mesh_summary_exporter import trigger_document_upload_export

# After processing document
trigger_document_upload_export(
    user_id="alice",
    document_name="project_spec.pdf",
    document_type="specification"
)
```

### Trigger Export on Concept Change

```python
from mesh_summary_exporter import trigger_concept_change_export

# After significant mesh change
trigger_concept_change_export(
    user_id="alice",
    change_type="merge",
    concept_count=10  # Only triggers if >= 5
)
```

### Manual Export

```python
from mesh_summary_exporter import trigger_manual_export

# User requests immediate export
trigger_manual_export(
    user_id="alice",
    reason="User clicked 'Refresh Context' button"
)
```

## 📈 Key Features

### Debouncing

Prevents export spam with configurable cooldown:
- Default: 10 minutes between exports per user
- Force flag bypasses debounce for critical events
- Thread-safe with proper locking

### Event Logging

All exports logged to `logs/mesh_export_events.log`:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-07T10:30:00Z",
  "user_id": "alice",
  "trigger": "intent_closed",
  "duration_seconds": 0.45,
  "success": true,
  "mode": "hybrid"
}
```

### Global Singleton

Single exporter instance for consistency:
```python
from mesh_summary_exporter import get_global_exporter

exporter = get_global_exporter({
    "export_mode": "hybrid",
    "debounce_minutes": 5
})
```

### Statistics Tracking

```python
stats = exporter.get_export_statistics()
# {
#   "mode": "hybrid",
#   "debounce_minutes": 10,
#   "trigger_counts": {
#     "intent_closed": 5,
#     "document_upload": 2,
#     "manual": 1
#   },
#   "total_exports": 8
# }
```

## 🎮 Testing

### Run Live Export Tests

```bash
python python/tests/test_live_export.py
```

Expected output:
```
TEST 1: Event-Driven Export ✓
TEST 2: Intent Closure Trigger ✓
TEST 3: Document Upload Trigger ✓
TEST 4: Concept Change Trigger ✓
TEST 5: Hybrid Mode ✓
TEST 6: Export Logging ✓

Total: 6/6 tests passed
```

## 📊 Benefits

### Ultra-Fresh Context
- Intent closures immediately reflected in prompts
- New documents instantly available to AI
- Concept changes propagate in real-time

### Intelligent Triggering
- Only exports on significant events
- Debouncing prevents resource waste
- Hybrid mode ensures nothing missed

### Complete Auditability
- Every export logged with trigger and duration
- Statistics for monitoring and optimization
- Debug metadata for troubleshooting

## 🔧 Integration Points

### Intent System
```python
# In intent_trace.py
def close_intent(self, user_id, intent_id):
    # ... close intent logic ...
    if self.enable_live_export:
        trigger_intent_closed_export(user_id, intent_id)
```

### Document Pipeline
```python
# In document_processor.py (future)
def process_document(self, user_id, doc):
    # ... process document ...
    trigger_document_upload_export(user_id, doc.name)
```

### Concept Mesh
```python
# In concept_mesh.py (future)
def merge_concepts(self, user_id, concepts):
    # ... merge logic ...
    if len(concepts) >= 5:
        trigger_concept_change_export(user_id, "merge", len(concepts))
```
