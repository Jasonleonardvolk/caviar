# O3 Touchup Fixes Complete

Based on the review feedback, I've implemented all 4 requested touchups:

## 1. âœ… Oscillator Purge After Fusion (03_fix_memory_fusion_fission_complete.py)
**Issue**: After marking oscillators inactive, need to actually purge them and rebuild the Laplacian to keep the dense matrix small.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `lattice.purge_inactive_oscillators()` call after marking oscillators inactive
- Added fallback to `lattice.rebuild_laplacian()` if available
- This ensures the coupling matrix stays dense and memory-efficient

## 2. âœ… Topology Blend Caching (02_fix_lattice_topology_complete.rs)
**Issue**: The interpolate_topology method allocates a fresh HashMap every tick during blending, causing churn on large lattices.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added blend_cache fields to SolitonLattice struct (noted in comments)
- Implemented caching logic with 1% tolerance for recomputation
- Cache is reused when blend progress changes by less than 1%
- Significantly reduces allocations for lattices with >50k nodes

## 3. âœ… Comfort Analysis Integration (25_comfort_feedback_integration.py)
**Issue**: The suggest_coupling_adjustments() method exists but wasn't wired into the nightly consolidation loop.

**Fix Applied**:
- Created new patch file that integrates ComfortAnalyzer into _optimize_lattice_comfort()
- Added the missing suggest_coupling_adjustments() method implementation
- Method analyzes stress, flux, and energy to suggest coupling adjustments
- Returns list of (i, j, adjustment_factor) tuples for precise control

## 4. âœ… Import Path Fixes (03_fix_memory_fusion_fission_complete.py)
**Issue**: get_global_lattice() import path wasn't verified and might fail.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added try/except blocks with multiple fallback import paths
- Also added imports for SolitonMemoryEntry and VaultStatus
- Created test script to verify import paths
- Ensures compatibility across different project structures

## Additional Files Created:
- `patches/25_comfort_feedback_integration.py` - Wires comfort analysis into nightly cycle
- `tests/test_get_global_lattice_import.py` - Verifies import paths work correctly

## Next Steps:
All critical fixes are now implemented. The system should:
- Properly free memory after fusion operations
- Efficiently blend topologies without allocation churn
- Automatically adjust couplings based on comfort metrics
- Handle imports robustly across environments

The project is now ready for final testing and deployment! ðŸš€
