# O4 Gap Completion Summary

All gaps from `gaps.txt` have been successfully addressed. Here's what was implemented:

## 1. SDK/CLI Layer ✅
- Created `tools/solitonctl.py` - Command-line wrapper for soliton operations
- Created `sdk/__init__.py` - Public API façade with SolitonSDK class
- Both provide clean interfaces to the underlying soliton memory system

## 2. Frontend Components ✅
- Created `frontend/dashboard/EnergyDashboard.tsx` - React component with real-time energy monitoring
- Created `frontend/visualizers/LatticeViewer.tsx` - WebGL 3D visualization of lattice topology
- Both connect to WebSocket channels for live updates

## 3. Business/Market Artifacts ✅
- Created `docs/BUSINESS_MODEL_PRICING.md` - Comprehensive pricing structure
- Created `docs/IP_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md` - IP protection strategy
- Moved PDF-only content into version-controlled documents

## 4. Soliton Preservation Fidelity Monitor ✅
- Created `python/core/fidelity_monitor.py` - Tracks soliton drift during morphing
- Added monitoring hooks in lattice_evolution_runner.py
- Logs warnings when drift exceeds threshold

## 5. Oscillator Purge After Fusion ✅
- Fixed in `python/core/soliton_memory_integration.py`
- Added `lattice.remove_oscillator(idx)` call after fusion
- Prevents phantom oscillators from bloating the coupling matrix

## 6. 3D Kagome Generator ✅
- Created `concept-mesh/src/lattice_topology_3d.rs`
- Implements `generate_kagome_3d()` with ABC stacking
- Configurable breathing ratio and inter-layer coupling
- Added module declarations in lib.rs

## 7. Hardware Stubs ✅
- Created `hardware/readout/interferometer_driver.rs` - Mock amplitude readout
- Created `python/hardware/readout_bridge.py` - PyO3 Python bindings
- Created `hardware/phase_switch/controller_stub.rs` - EO switching placeholder
